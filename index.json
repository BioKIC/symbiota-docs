These external servers provide image links, which can then be loaded into the Symbiota database.\n  Internally Hosted images are those stored on servers that are write-accessible to the Symbiota portal server. For example, if you coordinate with Arizona State University to batch upload images to one of their hosted portals (e.g., SEINet, Bryophyte Portal), your images are Internally Hosted.\n  Images uploaded or linked to specimens in a Symbiota portal should be JPGs or in another web-friendly format. It is recommended that individual files are no larger than 8 MB to allow users with slower connectivity to view them within a reasonable timeframe.\n Batch Adding Externally Hosted Images Externally Hosted images can be added to Symbiota records using one of three primary methods: (1) using the URL mapping tool and a spreadsheet of catalog numbers with image URLs (documentation coming soon!); (2) mapping a column of image links to the associatedMedia field when conducting a Full Text File Upload or Skeletal File Upload. For more information about uploading text files, see this page. If you already have data in the portal, and you just want to add image links, do NOT use Full Text File Upload; or (3) importing a Darwin Core Archive of your data with a fully-populated multimedia extension.\nBatch Adding Internally Hosted Images There are several workflows used to batch upload/link internally hosted specimen images. Batch processing typically consists of two separate steps: (1) Loading images onto a web server, and (2) Mapping image URLs to Symbiota occurrence records. Step (2) is possible when images are named according to the catalog number or other catalog number associated with the record in the portal.\nStorage of a large number of images on servers associated with a Symbiota portal may require an image-hosting agreement and/or incur image-hosting costs. Check with the portal administrator for more information about your portal\u0026rsquo;s image hosting allowances and workflows.

Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records.

In the Record Search Form, enter the stamped number into the Other Catalog Numbers field. Do not include leading zeros (e.g., if the stamp is 01499, enter 1499). Click Display Editor.  If no record is returned, double check that you entered the accession number correctly into the Other Catalog Numbers field and that there are no extra spaces before or after the numbers you typed. If the number is correct, contact a supervisor. If a record is returned, check that the data on the specimen record match the data on the label of the specimen in front of you, particularly collector, collector number, and date. i. If these data match, place your cursor in the Catalog Number field (top left) and scan the barcode of the specimen in front of you. The barcode number will then appear in this field.

Option 2: View new images in the portal and link by manually entering the accession number This protocol describes how to update your old accession number with the specimen’s new barcode number. You can do this only after you have uploaded specimen images into your portal through a batch process that has created new \u0026ldquo;unprocessed\u0026rdquo; records consisting of only a barcode number and an image.\n (Example instructions for an herbarium collection)\n Log in to your account and navigate to your Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). Click Edit Existing Occurrence Records. In the Record Search Form, click the Processing Status field and select “Unprocessed” from the dropdown menu. In the Custom Field 1 field, select Other Catalog Number from the first dropdown menu and IS NULL from the second dropdown menu. Click the “Display Editor” button. Locate the accession number (the stamped number, rather than the barcoded number or the collector number) on the specimen in the image to the right of the Occurrence Editor form.  You can zoom in by pressing Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and clicking on the image where you want to zoom in. Alternatively, you can hold Shift, click on the area where you want to zoom in, and move the mouse up (to zoom in) or down (to zoom out).   Enter the accession number, without leading zeros (e.g., if the number reads “0145”, you will enter “145”), into the Other Cat. #s field (circled in screenshot below).  Click outside of the Other Cat. #s field (or press the Tab button). A message should show up under the “Dupes?” button. Make sure that your browser’s pop-up blocker is disabled so you can see these messages.  If the message shows “No Dupes Found”:  Check that the specimen sheet is not stamped “Databased” or has any other indication that it SHOULD have a record in the database. If it is, try adding a leading zero to the accession number and repeat step 9. Press the Save Edits button (or press Tab and Enter on your keyboard) Move on to step 9.   If a pop-up window shows up that says “Record(s) using the same identifier already exists. Do you want to view this record?”:  Click OK. Check that the identified duplicate does not already have an image associated with it (if it does, you will see a bold barcode number on that record). If the duplicate does have an image already, close the window, scroll down to the Processing status field in the Curation box, select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu, and then click the Save Edits button. Otherwise, move to step c. Check that the data of the identified duplicate matches the data on the label of the specimen image you were viewing. You need not check every field, just two or three important fields such as Scientific Name, Collector, and Locality. If the data match up, click “Merge Records” and exit the duplicate window. If the data do not match up, close the window, scroll down to the Processing status field in the Curation box, select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu, and then click the Save Edits button.

Contact the collections manager to determine whether this is a preferred option. They may prefer that you send them the data for them to upload, and you can delete the specimen data from your own collection yourself (or contact a portal administrator for batch deletion).\n Open the specimen that you would like to transfer and click the Admin tab (far right).  From the dropdown menu, select the name of the collection to which you would like to transfer your record. This action will remove the specimen from your personal observation profile!  Batch transferring specimens from a personal profile to a collection Contact your portal administrator to batch transfer many specimens from your personal observation profile to another collection in the portal.\n","tags":["transfer","export"],"section":"col_obs"},{"date":"1639612800","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/join/mng/","title":"Management Types","summary":"There are two main ways that collections present their data in Symbiota portals: live or as a snapshot.

Furthermore, this workflow saves collections time and energy because they do not need to re-transcribe data.\n Most Symbiota portals have a central collection profile generally referred to as the \u0026ldquo;personal observation profile\u0026rdquo;. It is sometimes called the \u0026ldquo;general research observations\u0026rdquo; profile or \u0026ldquo;specimens being processed\u0026rdquo; profile. For example, see SEINet\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;General Research Observations\u0026rdquo; collection here. This collection profile is shared among all users who have been sponsored as editors of this collection profile; however, users may only edit records that they have entered into this profile. Records in this profile are publicly viewable once they are entered, but they may only be edited by the user who added them.\nThe personal observation profile is intended to be a place where collectors can manage their records (e.g., add and edit data, print specimen labels) and distribute the data to the collections where they will send their specimens, if applicable. A diagram of a generalized workflow is shown below.\nThis workflow saves everyone time and energy because collections do not need to re-transcribe the data. Morever, even though there may be many duplicates for a specimen, the data only need to be entered once. This single data entry also reduces the likelihood of data entry error.\nTo manage observation-only data (i.e., no specimens) see iNaturalist.\nUsers must be sponsored by a collection administrator in order to add and edit records to this collection profile.\nSponsored users have the following options for managing their data in the Personal Observations Profile collection.

For more information about the taxonomic thesaurus, visit the Taxonomy page.\n The taxonomic cleaning tools are great resources for cleaning up misspellings and other taxonomic name entries that do not link to names in the central taxonomic thesaurus. They are meant to aid in locating and fixing taxonomic errors and inconsistencies.\nAnalyze Taxonomic Names   This function analyzes the values that exist in the Scientific Name field in your database and flags the values that are not linked to the taxonomic thesaurus (i.e., are not linked to a recognized name). Note that this tool does NOT evaluate whether that name is accepted according to current taxonomy. The number of unrecognized scientific names is listed at the top of the Action Menu box.\nYou can evaluate the unrecognized scientific names and link them to the names of the correct taxa by clicking the name of the Taxonomic Resource to which you want to compare the names, selecting the target kingdom, and clicking the Analyze Taxonomic Names button. If you wish to begin at a certain name (e.g., you have already checked names up to Mentzelia), you can enter this name in the Start Index field. You can also alter the number of names you would like the portal to analyze per run in the Names Processed per Run field. There are multiple types of results from running this tool. In general, the tool will list the name that it is attempting to index (i.e., match to an existing taxonomic name), search your defined taxonomic resource for that name, and, if that name is not found in the taxonomic resource, check the taxonomic thesaurus for similar names to the unrecognized name. You then have several options for resolving the unrecognized name, depending on the type of result. To view the specimen(s) associated with any unrecognized name, click the pencil icon to the right of the name and number of specimens, in brackets. The types of results are explained in more detail below.\nExample 1: Misspelling, incomplete name, or orthographic variant This is the most common type of result. In this case, you discover that the unrecognized name was misspelled or spelled differently than the recognized name. You can click “remap to this taxon” to change the name of the specimen(s) to this recognized name.\nExample 2: Unpublished or unrecognized taxon name In this case, you find that the name listed on the specimen was not published or is not currently listed in the taxonomic thesaurus. You must then use taxonomic expertise to decide whether this specimen should be remapped to a different taxonomic name (if you are confident that they are synonymous) and/or annotated, or if the taxonomic name should be left as is and it should be included in the taxonomic thesaurus. If you believe that a name should be found in the taxonomic thesaurus and you do not find it with a manual search, contact the portal manager.\nExample 3: Name exists but is not found in taxonomic thesaurus When the portal does not find a name in the taxonomic thesaurus, but it does find the name in the taxonomic resource, it will import the taxonomic name into the taxonomic thesaurus. This will automatically map the specimen’s taxonomic name to this newly added entry in the taxonomic thesaurus as well.\nIf you have not analyzed all the taxonomic names in one pass, you can click the Continue Analyzing Names button to have Symbiota check the next 20 (or whatever number is defined by the user) names.\nTaxonomic Distributions Much like the Geographic Distribution viewer, the Taxonomic Distribution viewer can be used to examine the families, genera, species, and infraspecific taxa that exist in your database. Misspellings, non-standardized entries, or suspected mistakes can be detected using this tool. To view the genera for each family, click the name of the family. Then, to view the species for each genus, click the name of the genus, and so on. A user with administrator permissions can correct errors in taxonomic names individually by clicking the number next to the taxonomic name (circled below), or the user can search for those records using the record search form and batch edit them.\n","tags":["taxonomy","data cleaning"],"section":"coll_manager"},{"date":"1707350400","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/portal_manager/geothes/edit/","title":"Editing the Geographic Thesaurus","summary":"Use the Sitemap to navigate to the Geographic Thesaurus under \u0026ldquo;Administrative Functions (Super Admins only)\u0026rdquo;.

To ensure images are in the correct orientation in a Symbiota portal, you must ensure that the image has been rotated using a program that actually rotates the image data rather than just adding a EXIF metadata orientation tag (which is how most cameras and file explorers rotate images).\nAdjusting the camera settings to define the correct orientation, or batch rotating the images within file explorer on a PC are not ideal because they only modify the EXIF metadata orientation tag within the file and do NOT actually rotate the image file (pixel data). While many software programs (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, MS Windows Explorer, etc) will auto-rotate correctly based on the orientation tag and display the image correctly, not all software programs will do this (e.g. Internet Explorer, some browser plugins, etc). Furthermore, when images are upload on the web, the orientation tags are often not carried over to web derivatives generated by the file upload program (e.g. thumbnail, web views, etc). For example, the image links below will all have the wrong orientation when viewed in Internet Explorer (PC version), and only the full size (original) image will self-orient within Chrome or Firefox.\nThumbnail\nWeb View\nFull Size\nThe safest solution is to rotate the actual image data (pixel definition) rather than just the setting the orientation tag. This can be done as a batch processing using image editing programs such as Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. The link below provides a list of a number of free options for lossless rotation of images. For example, you can download “JPEG Lossless Rotator”, which is easy to use, shows the true rotation of the images within a folder, and provides lossless rotation tools.\nList of Lossless Rotation Apps\nLossless Rotator App by Anny Studio\nTroubleshooting Certain metadata can affect how images display in your web browser.

To upload an Excel file, first save as a CSV (comma delimited) text file. Formatting this file correctly is important to ensuring your taxonomy is successfully imported. At minimum, the file must include a column for ScientificName and the parent taxon (i.e. the taxon that nests immediately above the scientificName in your taxonomic hierarchy).\nFor example, to import the name Buccinum polaris Gray, 1839, your input file could include the following fields:\n   Taxon Rank Parent ScientificName Family Author RankID     species Buccinum Buccinum polaris Buccinidae Gray, 1839 220    However, if the higher taxonomy for this name does not already exist in your portal, the following rows should also be included in your file:\n   Taxon Rank Parent ScientificName Family Author RankID     division Animalia Mollusca   30   class Mollusca Gastropoda   60   order Gastropoda Neogastropoda   100   superfamily Neogastropoda Buccinoidea   130   family Buccinoidea Buccinidae Buccinidae  140   genus Buccinidae Buccinum Buccinidae  180   species Buccinum Buccinum polaris Buccinidae Gray, 1839 220    Download example CSV View example as a CSV\nTips for preparing your input file  Parent taxa must already exist in the portal\u0026rsquo;s thesaurus or be included in the input file. As an alternative to a parent taxon column, as shown above, the input file can contain columns for the core hierarchy that is defined within the taxonunits table (e.g. kingdom, division, class, subclass, order, family, etc). Values for rankid are assigned on the backend of your database in the table taxonunits. These value may vary between Symbiota portals. If you do not have access to these values, the Symbiota Support Hub can provide them to you for SSH-hosted portals. If a taxon\u0026rsquo;s acceptance status is not defined (0 = not accepted, 1 = accepted ), all taxa will be assumed to be accepted. Include a separate column in your input file to denote acceptance status, if desired. In the absence of a hierarchical definition (e.g. the parent taxa), infraspecific, specific, and genus linkages will be determined from ScientificName and linked to Family. If the Family value does not yet exist in the thesaurus and the hierarchy above Family is not defined in upload field, the taxon will be linked directly to Kingdom. You can only batch input taxonomy for one Kingdom at a time (Animalia, Fungi, etc.) Make sure not to map more than one source column to the same target, and that source column names are unique from one another. The batch loader will import new taxonomy in the order it appears in the file, starting with the first row. It is therefore best to organize the input file such that highest ranks appear first, followed by lower ranking taxa. Non-ranked nodes / unranked clades are supported by the bulk loader and do not require rankid values. However, it can be easier to ingest these names using the frontend interface, especially if only a few unranked names are to be added. Many fields that appear on Taxon Profile pages can be batch imported using this tool (e.g. vernacular names, language values, etc.). To preview what fields are available for bulk importing, create a small test CSV and open it using the steps 1-4 outlined in the following section. Contact the Hub or someone with backend access to add new ranks. Ranks are added on a per-kingdom basis and may require community discussion in order to be inserted into the hierarchy.  Ingest the File Using the Batch Loader Once your file is prepared, if your user account has the appropriate permissions, you can batch upload taxonomy from a spreadsheet (CSV) or text file by navigating to Sitemap \u0026gt; Taxonomy \u0026gt; Batch Upload a Taxonomic Data File \u0026gt; Taxa Upload.   Select your formatted input file.\n  Select the Target Thesaurus. (Your portal may only have one option.)\n  Select the Target Kingdom (all names in the input file will be associated with this Kingdom).\n  Once you select Map Input File, you will be prompted to map the fields in your input file to target fields in the database. Note that the parent taxon = parentstr and scientificName = scinameinput.   Once the fields are mapped, select Verify Mapping.\n  Once the file is processed, you will be given the option to review the new names as they were imported into the database\u0026rsquo;s internal staging tables. The is your last chance to preview changes before they are made permanent in the thesaurus; do so by selecting the link, Download CSV Taxa File. Look for an errorstatus column in the CSV explaining any records that failed to import.\n  If you are satisfied with the import, select Activate Taxa to transfer the new taxonomy to the portal\u0026rsquo;s thesaurus. If not, close the window and start over.\n  Tips for batch importing taxonomy  If you are new to this process, complete a few test imports to be sure your new taxon records are ingesting correctly. You can review new records in the Taxonomy Explorer (Sitemap \u0026gt; Additional Resources \u0026gt; Taxonomy Explorer). For especially complex taxonomic trees, import higher taxonomy first, then import new genera and species-level names. When batch importing synonyms, import all accepted names (and, if needed, their higher taxonomy) first. Then import the synonyms and their associated higher taxonomy. A column containing the accepted name for each synonym can be included in your input file.

You can define certain search criteria (e.g., a location or polygon in the map interface), view the results of this search, and add the taxa (and/or vouchers) that meet your search criteria.\n On the checklist page, click the center pencil icon with a v (\u0026ldquo;Manage Linked Vouchers\u0026rdquo;) at the top right of the page. This will take you to the voucher administration tools. If this is your first time defining search criteria, you will be prompted with a \u0026ldquo;Edit Search Statement\u0026rdquo; box. Use the fields available here to define the search criteria for the occurrences you would like to see. For example, you can list a state or county, taxon, a bounding box, or any combination of these (or additional) fields.  If you have previously created a search statement, you can edit your search statement by clicking the magnifying glass icon at the top of the page.    Take care to make your search statement general enough that you will get the maximum number of specimens; fewer criteria is better. For example, rather than including both \u0026ldquo;United States\u0026rdquo; in country and \u0026ldquo;Arizona\u0026rdquo; in state, try just using \u0026ldquo;Arizona\u0026rdquo; in state so that even records with \u0026ldquo;USA\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;United States of America\u0026rdquo; are included in your search results. You will likely need to conduct several different searches to ensure a complete result (e.g., do a search for \u0026ldquo;AZ\u0026rdquo; as well as one for \u0026ldquo;Arizona\u0026rdquo;).\n If you restrict your search based on coordinates, your results will be limited to specimens that have coordinate data. Depending on the portal, this may represent only 30-50% of available records.\n After you have defined your search criteria, click the Missing Taxa tab. In the Display Mode dropdown list, select Batch Linking.  From here you will see a table consiting of the first 1000 records that match your search criteria and that represent taxa that are not already in your checklist. To add taxa to the checklist from this page, check the boxes next to the vouchers with taxonomic names that you wish to add to your checklist (check the box in the top left corner of the table to check all the records in the table).\nTo add only the taxonomic names represented by these specimens to your checklist, check the \u0026ldquo;Add names without linking vouchers\u0026rdquo; box, then click the Submit Vouchers button. To add the taxonomic names and link vouchers to your checklist, leave this box unchecked and click the Submit Vouchers button.  After linking the desired taxa, refresh the list and link the next batch as necessary until all desired taxonomic names have been added.  Adding Individual Taxa    On the checklist page, click the rightmost pencil icon (labeled spp.) at the top right of the page. This will bring up a panel on the lower right side of the screen. Add the name of a taxon you wish to add. Do NOT include the authorship of the taxon. You can start typing, and a dropdown list will allow you to select the taxon from available options.  You cannot add a name that is not present in the taxonomic thesaurus (it will tell you if this is the case). If you find that the taxon you wish to add is not present:  Check that your spelling is correct. Use a vetted taxonomic resources, such as Tropicos or IPNI to check. If your spelling is correct, contact your portal manager with the name, authorship, and a reference or link to that name in another taxonomic database, and it will be added for you.     Fill in the other fields if desired. All of these fields can be left blank:  Family Override: If you enter the family name here, you will override the family provided by the taxonomic thesaurus. It is advised not to enter anything in this field. Habitat: If the taxon is usually found in a particular habitat in the area circumscribed by the checklist, you can include this information here. Abundance: Here you can note how frequently/abundantly this taxon is found in the area circumscribed by the checklist. For example, you can use terms like “common,” “frequent,” or “rare.” Notes: Any other comments about this taxon pertaining to your checklist area can be put here, for example: “Cultivated ornamental” or “favored by honeybees” Internal notes: This field, unlike the others, will be visible only to people authorized to edit the checklist. You might make a note “need to check the species” or “no picture available” for example. Source: This field is more likely to be used for research and teaching checklists. For such checklists, it is useful to know whether the information came from a flora, some other publication, or a report by some   Click the “Add species to List” button.  Batch Uploading Taxa from a File It is recommended to add a few taxa individually before attempting a batch upload so that you can get familiar with the data types and formats.\n   If you have several taxa to add at one time, you can upload them in a CSV (comma separated value) file. The easiest way to create the desired listing is to use Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc and then save the file as a CSV file. In your CSV file, one column in the file should be labeled sciname. This should contain the scientific name of the taxon WITHOUT the authorship included. In this CSV file, you must be very careful to spell the scientific names correctly. If you have an error in your spelling, you will not be able to load that name into your checklist. You can also include “family”, “habitat”, “abundance”, and “notes” columns (see above for descriptions of these fields) in this file. An example is shown below.\n   Sciname Habitat Abundance Notes     Asystasia gangetica Middle of the field Rare Demonstration; correct spelling   Asystasia gangetca field unknown Demonstration; wrong spelling    Below is a screenshot of uploading the previous example “file”. Note that only one name, the one that was correctly spelled, was uploaded.\nTo return to the Checklist, click “Return to Checklist” at the top left of the page (underlined below).\nYou can then view the taxa that were added to the checklist.\n","tags":["checklist","inventory","flora"],"section":"user"},{"date":"1633564800","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/data_publishing/dwc/","title":"Creating a Darwin Core Archive","summary":"This page describes how you can package your data as a Darwin Core Archive (standard format for data publishing and sharing) in a Symbiota portal.\n A Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) is a data standard that is commonly used to package species occurrence data into a single, self-contained dataset.

These external servers provide image links, which can then be loaded into the Symbiota database.\n  Internally Hosted images are those stored on servers that are write-accessible to the Symbiota portal server. For example, if you coordinate with Arizona State University to batch upload images to one of their hosted portals (e.g., SEINet, Bryophyte Portal), your images are Internally Hosted.\n  There are three catefories of images that can be linked to a Symbiota portal. Instructions for uploading individual images of each of these types are provided below.

Perform a quick search on the home page for the taxon of interest.   Click the pencil icon at the top right corner of the taxon page. Click the Add Image tab. Select the image file you would like to upload from Choose File, then enter any additional information in the provided fields.  The Sort Sequence field allows you to determine the order of the images that will show up on the taxon profile. The higher the number, the further down the priority list the image will be.   Click the Upload Image button. Field images are uploaded and managed through the Taxon Profile Editing interface. Users with Taxon Profile editing permissions can submit an image by clicking on the editing symbol located in the upper right of any Taxon Profile page, or through the image submission links available on the sitemap page. Field images with specific locality details (e.g. coordinates) can be loaded as Image Vouchers (see below).  Image Vouchers (field images with location information) Field images with specific locality information can serve as vouchers for field observations of many birds, mammals, and easy-to-identify plants. There are, however, some taxonomic groups that typically require microscopic or chemical analysis for accurate identification (e.g. lichens, bryophytes, fungi). For such organisms, field images will have limited value. For this reason, some data portals might not allow the submission of observations without a physical specimen.\nIt is particularly important that images intended as vouchers for an observation be of high quality and clearly display diagnostic morphology of the organism. Data fields required for an image to qualify as a voucher include: observer name, observation date, country, state, locality description, latitude, longitude, and at least one image.\nAs is the case with images of physical specimen, Image Vouchers are displayed on both the Occurrence Details and the Taxon Profile pages. Image-supported observations can be uploaded in a General Research Observation profile. The following video describes how to gain access to and submit observations to such a collection:\n  ","tags":["images"],"section":"editor"},{"date":"1632873600","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/label/packet/","title":"Specimen Packet Printing","summary":"This guide describes the use of the label printing tool in Symbiota to print lichen and bryophyte packets: full sheets of paper with a 3”x5” label printed on the bottom third of the sheet.

Scroll down to the Label Printing form at the bottom of the page. From the Label Profiles dropdown menu, select Generic Lichen Packet. From here, you can customize your packet in a limited number of ways: To change the heading prefix: edit the text in the Heading Prefix field To change the auto-generated middle section of the heading by selecting a button from the Heading Mid-Section options. To change the end of the heading: edit the text in the Heading Suffix field To change the name of your collection that will show up on top of your barcode: edit the text in the Label Footer field  NOTE: There is no actual “Footer” on lichen and bryophyte packets. Instead, the label footer is shown atop the printed barcode. Leave this blank if you would not like any text on top of your barcode OR if you are not including a barcode on your packet   To show the authorship of the species before the infraspecific epithet, if you are printing taxa with infraspecific epithets: check the box next to “Print species authors for infraspecific taxa” You do NOT need to check the box next to Print Catalog Numbers. The catalog number will be displayed underneath the barcode if “Include barcode of Catalog Number” is checked. Clicking “Print only Barcode” will print a barcode only with no packet or other data Note that Other Catalog Numbers are not listed on packets by default. To add this field, create a custom label packet profile as described in the next section and include Other Catalog Numbers in your list of printed fields. When printing your packet, make sure to print at 100% scale. Use Print Preview and adjust the margins as necessary so that the packet is centered and the correct size. If printing from Google Chrome, click the More Settings option and uncheck the Headers and footers box.  Customizing Your Own Packet-Printing Profile  Complete steps 1-7 as above. Click the pencil icon next to Label Profiles.  Find the profile labeled Generic Lichen Packet. To customize the packet-printing profile for your own personal use, click the Select Target option under Generic Lichen Packet and select “User Profile”. To customize the 5. packet-printing profile for your entire collection (i.e., other people will also be able to use this profile), select “Collection Profile” from the dropdown menu. Click the Clone Profile button under Generic Lichen Packet. When the page reloads, you will see a new profile under your collection profiles or user profiles (depending on what you selected in step 5 above). Click the pencil icon next to the title of the new, cloned label profile to edit the profile. Do NOT edit the Default CSS, Custom CSS, and Custom JS fields, but you can edit the title, prefix, etc. as above.  To remove the barcode from your packet, uncheck the box next to Display barcode. If you do this, make sure to delete “Custom Collection Name” from the Footer text field.   To edit which fields are listed on your packet and/or the orientation of those fields, scroll down to the JSON field and click “visual interface”.   In the bottom center of the screen, you will see a preview of the label that you are customizing. The left-hand Fields Available column contains a bank of fields that you can draw from and include on your label The grey Label Content Area in the center is where you can place and move the fields that you have selected from the Fields Available column for your label The Field Options on the top right can be used to edit the prefix, suffix, font size, position, and font family of a field after selecting a field in the Label Content Area. The Line Options on the bottom right can be used to select a delimiter between fields on the same line and edit the text alignment and spacing after selecting a line in the Label Content Area. To add a new line, scroll to the bottom of the Label Content Area and click the ADD LINE button. Beware of adding additional lines to the Label Content Area! If you have too much content, it may not fit on the packet label.  Customize your label by adding fields (drag and drop fields from the Field Available column into the Label Content Area), removing fields (click the x icon next to the field in the Label Content Area), editing fields (using Field Options), and editing lines (using Line Options) as desired. Click the SAVE FORMAT \u0026amp; CLOSE button. Follow steps 1-7 of Using the Default Packet-Printing Profile. From the Label Profiles field, select your new label printing format from the dropdown list. Click the Print in Browser button. If your new label profile does not meet your expectations, return to the label profile editor (steps 7-9 above) and edit the profile as desired. For small edits that are specific to the specimen data you are working with (e.g., special character issues or spacing issues), you can also edit the label in the print preview. After clicking Print in Browser as above, click the Edit Labels Content button in the top left corner of your screen. From here, you can make small adjustments to the label(s) that you currently intend to print. Note that these changes do not change the label profile that you have created.

Click the pencil icon that has a V next to it (the center icon in the top right corner of the page, highlighted below).  If this is the first time you have used this tool, you will be asked to first define the search statement (i.e., search parameters) that will be used to find the specimens that might pertain to your checklist. You can use a variety of fields to define your search, as described below.  You will be able to change the search statement in the future, so you are not necessarily defining the bounds forever.\n  You can enter search terms for a number of fields on the left side of the form. You can use the polygon footprint that you defined when creating the checklist (see 29:1 Creating a checklist, step 3c) to search for specimen records by checking the “Search based on polygon defining checklist research boundaries” box. If you did not define a polygon previously, you can also do so from here by clicking the pencil icon to the right of this option and following the steps outlined in 29:1 Creating a checklist, step 3c. You can define a specific bounding box by entering the latitude and longitude values that delimit the box, or by defining the lat/long values on a map. To do the latter:  Click the globe icon to the right of the Lat North field In the pop-up window, pan and zoom to the location where you want to place the bounding box. Click on the approximate center where you want the bounding box to be located. Adjust the location and size of the bounding box as desired by clicking and dragging inside the box (to move the box) or clicking and dragging one of the circles on the sides or corners of the box (to resize the box). To save the bounding box, click Save and Close.     There are a number of important checkboxes below the Lat/Long fields that you can use to refine your search. For example, you can allow the search to return specimens with the desired search terms OR within certain latitude and longitude coordinates. You can use any combination of the above options to search for voucher specimens.  Once you have entered the desired search terms, click the Save Search Terms button. There are a number of ways to add voucher specimens from this point.   If you have already defined a taxon list for your checklist, you can add voucher specimens from the New Vouchers tab. From this tab, you can:  View taxa that do not currently have voucher specimens in your checklist (select Non-vouchered taxa list from the Display Mode dropdown list). View specimen records that match your search criteria and are one of the taxa defined in your taxon list that is NOT currently vouchered (select Occurrences for non-vouchered taxa from the Display Mode dropdown list).  To add voucher specimens from this list, click the box to the left of the specimen record(s) that you wish to add and click the Add Vouchers button.   View specimen records that match your search criteria and are one of the taxa defined in your taxon list, regardless of whether that taxon has been vouchered previously (select New occurrences for all taxa from the Display Mode dropdown list).   To add voucher specimens from this list, click the box to the left of the specimen record(s) that you wish to add and click the Add Vouchers button. Regardless of whether you have previously defined a taxon list for your checklist, you can add voucher specimens through the Missing Taxa tab. From this tab, you can:  View the taxa that are not found in the checklist currently but are represented by one or more specimens that align with your search criteria (select Species List from the Display Mode dropdown list).  You can then view a list of the specimens associated with each taxon by clicking the link icon From there, you can link the desired specimens individually by clicking the add voucher icon to the right of the specimen record in the list.   View the specimens that are not yet added as voucher specimens for your checklist but do align with your search criteria (select Batch Linking from the Display Mode dropdown menu).  To add voucher specimens from this list, click the box to the left of the specimen record(s) that you wish to add and click the Add Vouchers button.   View specimen records that align with your search criteria, but have scientific names that are not linked to a particular name in the taxonomic thesaurus (select Problem Taxa from the Display Mode dropdown menu).  To add voucher specimens from this list, enter the name of the taxon to which this specimen belongs into the text box to the right of the specimen’s scientific name. Note that the name you enter in this box must already be found in the list of taxa in your checklist. Click the Link Voucher button.      Adding Individual Specimens from Your Own Collection You must be an editor of a collection to assign specimens in this way.\n  Look up a specific specimen in your own collection (e.g., by clicking Edit Existing Occurrence Records in your Data Editor Control Panel and searching by a specific catalog number or by using other search terms). On the resulting page, click the Linked Resources tab. In the Checklist Voucher Linkages box (see below), select the desired Checklist from the dropdown menu and click Link to Checklist as Voucher.

These maps can be dot maps or heat maps, and both rely entirely on the distributions of georeferenced records available in the portal. These maps must therefore be interpreted in the context of the geographic and/or taxonomic focus on the specific portal.\n Navigate to the tool through the Sitemap by scrolling down to the Administrative Functions (Super Admins only) heading and clicking Manage Taxon Profile Map Thumbnails.\nThe map on the resulting page will be automatically centered to the default map coordinates as defined in the Symbini file. To adjust the bounds of the map, click and drag on the map, use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out, respectively, and/or use the rectangle drawing tool, which will zoom you closer to a specific area on the map. Double click the map to zoom in.\nYou can also manually set the boundaries of the map viewing box by editing the latitude and longitude values in the Bounds box. Click the \u0026ldquo;Global Bounds\u0026rdquo; button to represent a global map.\nYou can change the base layer of the map by clicking the layers icon in the top right corner of the map and selecting the appropriate radio button from the options.\nStart typing the name of taxon for which you would like to generate a map in the \u0026ldquo;Taxon Name\u0026rdquo; field and select a matching taxon from the taxonomic thesaurus. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find your taxon of interest in the dropdown list, add it to the taxonomic thesaurus.\nIf you select a taxon with any children taxa (e.g., you select a genus or family name), clicking the \u0026ldquo;Build Map(s)\u0026rdquo; button will run through all the children taxa of that taxon and build thumbnail maps for all with available specimens using the parameters you have selected. A thumbnail map will not be created for the parent taxon (genus or family)\n Adjust the parameters and click the \u0026ldquo;Preview Map\u0026rdquo; button to adjust the appearance of your thumbnail map. Depending on number of available records and the distribution of your taxon, you may need to play with the available parameters to produce a useful thumbnail.\n If you want to create a map of points where records are located, select the \u0026ldquo;Dot Map\u0026rdquo; option from the Map Type box. Select \u0026ldquo;Heat Map\u0026rdquo; for a heat map. Check the box next to \u0026ldquo;Automatically adjust bounds to fit coordinate data\u0026rdquo; if you would like the map boundaries to adjust automatically to include all the georeferenced records of that taxon. ⚠️ If you adjust the boundaries of the map manually and would like to keep those boundaries, make sure you uncheck the \u0026ldquo;Automatically adjust bounds to fit coordinate data\u0026rdquo; box before clicking \u0026ldquo;Build Map(s)\u0026rdquo;.  Once you are satisfied with the appearance of your map, click \u0026ldquo;Build Map(s)\u0026rdquo;.\nHeat Map Parameters The appearance of the heat map can be adjusted by changing the heat radius (using the slider) and the heat density (using the minimum and maximum density fields).\nA larger heat radius would mean that each point is represented by a larger colored area on the map.\nWhereas a smaller heat radius makes each point represent a smaller colored area on the map.\nSetting a smaller Minimum Density value will require a certain number of records to be present in an area before it will show up as \u0026ldquo;heat\u0026rdquo; on the map, and it will intensify the \u0026ldquo;heat\u0026rdquo; of locations with multiple records. Setting a larger Minimum Density value will lower the relative \u0026ldquo;heat\u0026rdquo; of hot spots.\nDot Map Parameters To adjust the color of the map, click the grey square and adjust the hue and saturation in the pop-up box.

Enter the name of the collector/observer into the Collector/Observer field, the collector\u0026rsquo;s unique collector number (if applicable) into the Number field, and the date of collection into the Date field (in YYYY-MM-DD format). Click the \u0026ldquo;Duplicates\u0026rdquo; button.  You can turn an automatic duplicate search on or off using the \u0026ldquo;Auto search\u0026rdquo; checkbox. This will conduct a search for duplicates automatically after you enter the collector name, number, and date.\n There are three possible results of a duplicate search using this tool.\nPossible EXACT Duplicates This result occurs when a record with a matching collector last name, collector number, and date is found in a collection other than the one you are currently working in. This may represent a true duplicate specimen.\nPossible EXACT Duplicates with NOTICE This result occurs when a record with a matching collector last name, collector number, and date is found within the collection you are currently working in. This may represent a true duplicate specimen, if you have them in your collection, or it could represent unintentional duplicate data entry (i.e., an error).\nPossible Matching Duplicate EVENTS This result occurs when a record with a matching collector last name and date was found, but the exact collector number was not found. In this case, the results presented will include collector numbers slightly above and slightly below the number that you entered. These records may still be useful because they may share, e.g., locality data with the record that you are currently entering/editing.\nHandling duplicate match results You will have several options for using the results of the duplicate matching search. These will be listed at the bottom of the duplicate result that has been identified (see example below). You may:\nTransfer All Fields Transfer the data from all the fields in the identified duplicate specimen or event into the data entry page that you are currently working on. This will replace any data that you have already entered (e.g., if you entered \u0026ldquo;Luis Gonzalez\u0026rdquo; in the collector/observer name, and the duplicate had was \u0026ldquo;Gonzalez, Luis\u0026rdquo; in this field, \u0026ldquo;Gonzalez, Luis\u0026rdquo; would overwrite your previous entry). Clicking this option will transfer the data and close the duplicate matching window.\nTransfer to Empty Fields Only Transfer the data from all fields in the identified duplicate specimen or event into the data entry page that you are currently working on, unless that field already has data in it. Only empty fields will be populated. Your previous entries will remain the same. Clicking this option will transfer the data and close the duplicate matching window.\nLink as Duplicate Checking this box and then clicking one of the additional options will create a duplicate linkage between the record you are editing and the duplicate record. For more information about duplicate linkages, visit the Duplicate Clustering documentation.\nGo to Record This option is only available if the identified duplicate belongs to the same collection that you are currently editing. Clicking this option will take you to the occurrence editor page for the duplicate record so you can view it (e.g., if you want to verify the data or view the image). Once you have looked at the image, if you want to transfer any of the data into the record you are working on, you will need to click the \u0026ldquo;Duplicates\u0026rdquo; button on the record that you were editing again.\nMerge Records This option is only available if the identified duplicate belongs to the same collection that you are currently editing. If you click this option, the two records will be merged together. The record in the pop-up window will be prioritized over data in your occurrence editor. For example, if the record listed in the pop-up window has \u0026ldquo;USA\u0026rdquo; in the country field, and the record in the occurrence editor has \u0026ldquo;United States\u0026rdquo; in the country field, the merged record will have \u0026ldquo;USA\u0026rdquo; in the country field. Fields that are empty in one of the two records will be filled in with the data from the record that has data in that field. All images and linked resources will be included in the merged record. All unique determinations will be included in the merged record with the exception of any \u0026ldquo;current determination\u0026rdquo; belonging to the record in the occurrence editor, which will be discarded. As a result, you will have one current determination (belonging to the record in the pop-up window) and all other previous determinations associated with the record. For this reason, it is a good idea to check the Determinations tab of the merged record before moving on.\n","tags":["duplicate","copy","transfer"],"section":"editor"},{"date":"1634169600","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/checklist/create/","title":"Creating a Checklist","summary":"This page describes how to create a checklist or biotic inventory in a Symbiota portal.\n The \u0026ldquo;Create a Checklist\u0026rdquo; permission has been granted for the majority of existing users (accounts created before June 2022).

Remember that character states are the options that the user can choose from when trying to identify a sample. The character states are what the ID Key Editor will choose between when assigning a state to a certain taxon. See below for instructions on editing character states.\nIn the Taxonomic Linkages tab, you can apply the character to the highest phylogenetic/taxonomic node to which a character belongs. For example, if a character applies to all plants, you would apply the character to the entire kingdom Plantae. Taxonomic branches can also be excluded. For example, if a character was relevant to all families in an order except one, you could set the \u0026ldquo;Relevance to taxon\u0026rdquo; = \u0026ldquo;Relevant\u0026rdquo; for the order, then add the excluded family with \u0026ldquo;Relevance to taxon\u0026rdquo; = \u0026ldquo;Exclude\u0026rdquo;.\nThe final \u0026ldquo;Admin\u0026rdquo; tab allows you to delete the character.

If there are dots on the map, investigate whether any of them could be a good starting point for your georeferencing by comparing the dots’ locations on the map to the text in the Locality String (see dashed box in screenshot above). It is possible that none of the dots indicate the correct locality. If this is the case, you can ignore the dots or remove them by clicking the “# possible locations found” tab and clicking the circled ‘x’ to the left of each rejected entry (see below).  When deciding whether to use one of the GeoLocate dots, make sure to check that the state and county where the dot has been placed matches the state and county indicated by the record.    Either starting with a GeoLocate dot, if appropriate, or from scratch, use the Locality String to determine an approximate location for the specimen. This will likely require searching other references (e.g., Google maps) for location and feature names.  You can change the base layer (i.e., the type of map shown in the GeoLocate window) by clicking the plus symbol in the upper right corner of the window (see next screenshot). To measure a distance on the map, click the button next to “Measure” and click on a starting point on the map. You can then move your cursor anywhere on the map and a line will be measured between those two points. The length of the line will be shown in green next to the line. To measure between more than one point, click again to anchor another point. To stop measuring, double click on the ending point of your measurement. If there is not enough information in the Locality String to assign an approximate point, view the specimen record by returning to the search results page (see screenshot below) and clicking the pencil icon on the top right of the search results box. This will bring up the specimen record, where you can see whether there is more locality information in another data field (e.g., habitat) or on the specimen image (if available).  If you are still not able to assign an approximate point from this information, scroll down to the bottom of the specimen record until you see the Processing Status field. Select “Expert Required” from the dropdown menu of this field. In the “Notes (Occurrence Remarks)” field above and to the left, enter a brief note in brackets, such as “[Not enough data to georeference]”. Click the “Save Edits” button, close the record, and select a new record to georeference.       Once you have found an approximate location for the specimen record, click the button next to “Place Marker” and click on the map where you want to place the GeoLocate dot. We recommend using the Georeferencing Quick Guide to determine where to place the point.\n  Set the error radius and/or create an error polygon to indicate the uncertainty of the specimen’s locality. We recommend using the Georeferencing Quick Guide to determine how large of an error radius to use for a given point and whether you should use an error polygon.\n To edit the size of the error radius, click the green dot on the map and select “Edit Uncertainty” in the pop-up box. Click and drag the grey arrowhead that will appear on the outer rim of the error circle to resize the error radius. To create an error polygon, click the button next to “Create polygon” and click on the map where you want to begin drawing the polygon. A corner of the polygon will be created time you click on the map. To finish the polygon, double click. Once you have completed the polygon, click the green dot again and select “Resize uncertainty to polygon.”  To redo a polygon, click the “Clear Polygon” button to the right of the “Options” button.   Make sure to note any uncertainty you experienced when setting the error radius. For example, if you were georeferencing a named place that did not have clear boundaries, explain how you determined a suitable error radius by putting a note in the Remarks field on the search results page where you first selected your specimen record.    When you are confident in your GeoLocate point and error radius, click the “Save To Your Application” button at the bottom of the GeoLocate window. You will be taken back to the search results page where you first selected your specimen record (see first screenshot).  The coordinates and error will now show up below the search results in the appropriate Latitude, Longitude, and Error fields. If you created an error polygon, its coordinates will be listed in the Footprint WKT field.   Click the “Update Coordinates” button at the bottom of the page. Select a new record or set of records to georeference from the search results list and repeat.

(This problem may or may not be intentional, depending on your collection\u0026rsquo;s policies. It is generally best to not duplicate catalog numbers, when possible).\nSolution: Use the duplicate catalog number tool to view, edit, and/or merge duplicates. Note that only users with administrator permissions can use this tool.\nDates Date Hasn\u0026rsquo;t Happened Yet Problem: The date the specimen was collected (often designated using the eventDate field) is in the future.\nSolution: There are two ways you can find records with this problem:\nMethod 1:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In the Sort By field, select Date. Then select \u0026ldquo;descending\u0026rdquo; in the second dropdown list.  Click Display Table. After the page loads, the highest dates will be listed at the top of the resulting table. Edit these records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left).  Click the box and arrow icon to the right of the Symbiota ID number to open the record in a new window. That way, you will not need to re-conduct your search after editing every record.\n Method 2:\n Navigate to the public search page of your portal. This is most commonly done from the home page by selecting \u0026ldquo;Search\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Search Collections\u0026rdquo; from the header menu. If you are taken to a list of collections, check the \u0026ldquo;Select/Deselect all collections\u0026rdquo; box to deselect all the collections, then check the box next to your collection. Click the Search button. If you are not taken to a list of collections, proceed to step 3. In the Collector Criteria (or Collecting Event) section, enter today\u0026rsquo;s date in the first Collection Date field (or the Collection Start Date field) and 9999-12-31 in the second field (or the Collection End Date field). If you see a \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo; section of the search page, check the \u0026ldquo;Select/Deselect all collections\u0026rdquo; box to deselect all the collections, then check the box next to your collection. If there is no \u0026ldquo;Collections\u0026rdquo; section on the search page, you should have already selected your collection in step 2. Click the List Display button (or the Search button, if provided). The search results will show you all specimens supposedly collected after today\u0026rsquo;s date. You can view and edit these records by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Full Record Details\u0026rdquo; link underneath the specimen\u0026rsquo;s summary, then clicking the Occurrence Editor link on the resulting pop-up window.  Date is Suspiciously Old Problem: The date the specimen was collected (often designated using the eventDate field) is outside the expected historical date range. The expected date range depends on the institution, but it is unlikely that most collections have specimens with dates prior to 1600.\nSolution: See the methods described in the Date Hasn\u0026rsquo;t Happened Yet section, but do the following modifications:\nMethod 1:\nIn step 2, select \u0026ldquo;ascending\u0026rdquo; in the second dropdown list in the Sort By field. You will also likely want to filter out records without dates by selecting Date from Custom Field 1 and selecting IS NOT NULL from the second dropdown list. This will remove any blank dates from your search results, which would normally show up at the beginning of your ascending list.\nMethod 2:\nIn step 3, enter 0001-01-01 in the first Collection Date field (or the Collection Start Date field) and the earliest date you think would be possible in your collection (e.g., 1700-01-01) in the second field (or the Collection End Date field).\nIdentified Date Earlier than Collected Date Problem: The date the specimen was identified (dateIdentified field) is earlier than the date the specimen was collected (eventDate).\nSolution: This problem cannot be identified using Symbiota portal tools. To locate records with this issue, download your data from the public search page, as a backup file, or using the exporter tool. You can then use a spreadsheet program to compare the dateIdentified to the eventDate field (see Excel instructions here).\nYear, Month, and Day Values Do Not Match Date Problem: The event year, month, and day values do not match the provided event date. The event date is often the date of collection for preserved specimens.\nSolution: This problem cannot be identified using Symbiota portal tools. To locate records with this issue, download your data from the public search page, as a backup file, or using the exporter tool. You can then use a spreadsheet program to compare the dateIdentified to the eventDate field (see Excel instructions here).\nGeography Coordinates are Zero Problem: The provided latitude and/or longitude values are 0.\nSolution:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Latitude from the first dropdown menu, select EQUALS from the second dropdown menu, and enter 0 into the blank field. Either individually edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left), or batch edit all entries using the Batch Editing Tool. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the Decimal Longitude field. Alternatively, you can search for records with 0 for both latitude and longitude by adding another custom search term. To do so, click the pencil icon to the right of Custom Field 1 and adjust the fields of Custom Field 2 accordingly.  Coordinates Do Not Fall Within Named Geographic Unit Problem: The provided coordinates do not fall within the geographic boundaries of the named country, state, and/or county.\nSolution: The problem cannot currently be identified using Symbiota portal tools. We recommend using the GBIF Reverse Geocoding API to verify coordinate-country matching, or by simply publishing your data to GBIF and viewing the data quality flags of your dataset.\nGeoreference Metadata with no Associated Georeference Problem: Metadata fields regarding coordinates, such as coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, georeferenceProtocol, georeferenceSources, georeferencedBy, georeferenceRemarks, and geodeticDatum are provided, but no coordinates are present. This is sometimes intentional, particularly when georeferencedBy and georeferencedRemarks are used to indicate whether a record was purposefully not georeferenced. However, it is rare that the other metadata fields can be used without associated coordinates (i.e., decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, or verbatimCoordinates).\nProblem:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Latitude from the first dropdown menu and select IS NULL from the second dropdown menu. Click the pencil icon to the right of Custom Field 1 to add another custom field. In Custom Field 2, select the georeference metadata field you would like to compare (see list of suggestions above) and select IS NOT NULL from the second dropdown menu. Click Display Table. Edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left).  Click the box and arrow icon to the right of the Symbiota ID number to open the record in a new window. That way, you will not need to re-conduct your search after editing every record.\n Elevation is Unlikely Problem: Elevation values are either too high (\u0026gt;17000 m) or too low (-11000 m) to occur on Earth.\nSolution:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. Do one of the following:  Minimum Elevation: In Custom Field 1, select Elevation Minimum from the first dropdown menu, select LESS THAN from the second dropdown menu, and enter -11000 into the blank field. Maximum Elevation: In Custom Field 1, select Elevation Maximum from the first dropdown menu, select GREATER THAN from the second dropdown menu, and enter 17000 into the blank field.   Click Display Table. Edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left).  Improperly Negated Latitudes/Longitudes Problem: The sign of the latitude (decimalLatitude) or longitude (decimalLongitude) does not match the sign/hemisphere of the given country. For example, all longitudes in the U.S. should be negative.\nSolution: The problem cannot currently be identified using Symbiota portal tools. We recommend using the GBIF Reverse Geocoding API to verify coordinate-country matching, or by simply publishing your data to GBIF and viewing the data quality flags of your dataset.\nInvalid Coordinates Problem: Coordinates deviate from accepted ranges or formats, like decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude exceeding -90 to 90 and -180 to 180, respectively. verbatimCoordinates have to be valid values for coordinates in decimal degrees, degrees decimal minutes, degrees minutes second.\nSolution: Some types of invalid coordinates can be identified using the Record Search Form.\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. Do one of the following:  In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Latitude from the first dropdown menu, select LESS THAN from the second dropdown menu, and enter -90 in the blank field. In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Latitude from the first dropdown menu, select GREATER THAN from the second dropdown menu, and enter 90 into the blank field. In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Longitude from the first dropdown menu, select LESS THAN from the second dropdown menu, and enter -180 into the blank field. In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Longitude from the first dropdown menu, select GREATER THAN from the second dropdown menu, and enter 180 into the blank field.   Click Display Table. Edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left).  Lower Geography Values are Provided, but No Higher Geography Problem: Lower geography (e.g., county, state/province) values exist, but no higher geography values (e.g., country) are provided.\nSolution: This issue can be quickly identified and fixed using the geography cleaning tools. Note that you must have administrator permissions to use these tools.\nMinimum and Maximum Elevation Values Mismatched Problem: The minimum elevation (minimumElevationInMeters) has a greater value than the maximum elevation (maximumElevationInMeters).\nSolution: This problem cannot currently be identified using Symbiota portal tools. To locate records with this issue, download your data from the public search page, as a backup file, or using the exporter tool. You can then use a spreadsheet program to compare the minimumElevationInMeters to the maximumElevationInMeters field (see Excel instructions here).\nMismatched Country and CountryCode Values Problem: The provided value for country and countryCode do not match.\nSolution: This problem cannot currently be identified using Symbiota portal tools. To locate records with this issue, download your data from the public search page, as a backup file, or using the exporter tool. You can then use a spreadsheet program to compare the unique combinations of country and countryCode to look for deviations (see Excel instructions here).\nMissing Geodetic Datum Problem: Geodetic datum is a key piece of a properly georeferenced specimen, but is usually left blank. Although it is commonly assumed to be in \u0026lsquo;WGS84\u0026rsquo;, this should be added and noted as such.\nSolution:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select Geodetic Datum from the first dropdown list and IS NULL from the second dropdown. Click the pencil icon to the right of Custom Field 1 to add another Custom field. In Custom Field 2, select Decimal Latitude from the first dropdown list and IS NOT NULL from the second dropdown. Either individually edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left), or batch edit all entries using the Batch Editing Tool.  Mismatched Geographic Terms Problem: A record has lower geographic terms (e.g., state/province, county) that do not exist under the provided higher geographic term(s). For example, country = Canada and stateProvince = Sussex. There is no Sussex province in Canada.\nSolution: This issue can be quickly identified and fixed using the geography cleaning tools. Note that you must have administrator permissions to use these tools.\nMissing Latitudes/Longitudes Problem: A record has a latitude value, but not a longitude value, or vice versa.\nSolution:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select Decimal Latitude (or Decimal Longitude) from the first dropdown list and IS NOT NULL from the second dropdown. Click the pencil icon to the right of Custom Field 1 to add another Custom field. In Custom Field 2, select Decimal Longitude (or Decimal Latitude, whichever is not the same as what you entered in Custom Field 1) from the first dropdown list and IS NULL from the second dropdown. Edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left).  Misspelled Geographic Unit Names Problem: The geographic units (e.g., country, state/province, county) are misspelled, resulting in poor matching of geographic unit names to existing geographic lists.\nSolution: This issue can be quickly identified and fixed using the geography cleaning tools. Note that you must have administrator permissions to use these tools.\nTaxonomy Misspelled or Invalid Taxonomic Names Problem: Scientific names are misspelled, resulting in poor matching of taxonomic names to taxonomic databases.\nSolution: This issue can be quickly identified and fixed using the taxonomic cleaning tools. Note that you must have administrator permissions to use these tools.\nUnknown Higher Taxonomy Problem: Species may be missing higher taxonomic information.\nSolution: This is only a problem in Symbiota portals if you have scientific names that are not included in the taxonomic thesaurus. You can use the [taxonomic cleaning tools]](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/data_cleaning/taxonomy/) to automatically import names from Catalog of Life or other resources into the thesaurus (your ability to do this depends on the portal), or contact your portal administrator about adding missing names to the thesaurus.\nOther Issues Incorrect Character Encodings Problem: Data inconsistencies arise when incorrect character encodings are used during data manipulation or transfer. This issue occurs when datasets are opened, downloaded, or imported across different software platforms, leading to misinterpretation and garbled text. For instance, special characters like accents or symbols may be rendered incorrectly, affecting the readability and accuracy of the data. (e.g., Carl LinnÃ©).\nSolution: There is no cross-field searching tools that would enable you to find mis-rendered symbols across all fields, but you can search certain fields. For example:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select a field to search from the first dropdown list, select CONTAINS from the second dropdown, and enter a mis-converted character (e.g., Ã©) into the blank field. This page provides a helpful table with common problems with character encodings. You can conduct searches for the values in the \u0026ldquo;Actual\u0026rdquo; column and replace them with the values in the \u0026ldquo;Expected\u0026rdquo; column. For example, if you suspect there are \u0026ldquo;ë\u0026rdquo; values in a certain field, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to search on \u0026ldquo;Ã«\u0026rdquo;. Either individually edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left), or batch edit all entries using the Batch Editing Tool.  Incorrect Line Endings Problem: When transferring text files between Unix/Linux and DOS/Windows systems, line endings can become inconsistent. Unix/Linux systems typically use line feed (LF) characters, while DOS/Windows systems use carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) combinations. This mismatch can result in extra characters appearing in the data, causing visual artifacts and processing errors.\nSolution: This is unlikely to be a problem for data that has already been imported into a Symbiota portal. It is possible that erroneous (¶) symbols will be retained. In this case:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select a field to search from the first dropdown list (such as Locality), select CONTAINS from the second dropdown, and enter ¶ into the blank field. Either individually edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left), or batch edit all entries with this symbol using the Batch Editing Tool.  Invalid Individual Count Problem: individualCount values may not make sense as a positive integer.\nSolution:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select Individual Count from the first dropdown list, select LESS THAN from the second dropdown list, and enter 1 in the blank field. Edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left).  Alternatively, you can just scan through the table where Individual Count IS NOT NULL and look for discrepancies by eye.\nNon-standardized BasisOfRecord Values Problem: Values in the BasisOfRecord field do not match the recommended controlled vocabulary. While using standardized terms in this field is not strictly necessary, doing so does improve the discoverability and interoperability of your data.\nThe currently accepted values for BasisOfRecord include: MaterialEntity, PreservedSpecimen, FossilSpecimen, LivingSpecimen, MaterialSample, Event, HumanObservation, MachineObservation, Taxon, Occurrence, MaterialCitation.\nNote that even punctuation and capitalization differences in these values (e.g., Preserved Specimen) are discouraged.\nSolution:\n Navigate to the Record Search Form for your collection. In Custom Field 1, select Basis of Record from the first dropdown list, select NOT EQUALS from the second dropdown list, and enter \u0026ldquo;PreservedSpecimen\u0026rdquo; in the blank field. Click the pencil icon to the right of Custom Field 1 to add another Custom field. In Custom Field 2, select Basis of Record from the first dropdown list, select NOT EQUALS from the second dropdown list, and enter \u0026ldquo;FossilSpecimen\u0026rdquo; in the blank field. Repeat steps 3-4 for as many other valid BasisOfRecord values you think might exist in your collection. Either individually edit erroneous records by clicking the link in the Symbiota ID column (far left), or batch edit all entries using the Batch Editing Tool.

Look for a \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Checklists\u0026rdquo; tab at the top of your portal interface.\n  Select the checklist containing content that you wish to play with. On the checklist page, click the \u0026ldquo;Games\u0026rdquo; link at the top of the Options box.   Name Game Summary \u0026ldquo;Name Game\u0026rdquo; is a memory recall game that prompts users to guess (and spell) a genus and species included in a checklist.\nHow to play  Begin by guessing a letter that you believe might occur in the genus or species epithet. Every time you incorrectly guess a letter, your remaining number of chances (3-12) will decrease. The :rose: :sunflower: :apple: icons simply visualize your progress and remaining number of changes (i.e., the rose withers, the apple is consumed, and the flower petals are removed with diminishing chances). Hints: Selecting a hint will cost you one chance, and they cannot be used on your last guess. On the keypad, select the ? (wildcard) button to fill in one letter for you; the Show Family button will display the species' family. If you correctly guess the genus and species before your chances run out (0), your number of games won will increase. If you do not correctly guess the species, select Reveal the Answer to display the answer. In either case, a link will then appear to the taxon record for further study. New Game will prompt the next question. Your number of games played, won, and success rate will be tracked as you continue playing and initiate new games.  Other tips  Your selected difficulty level affects how many chances you get: 3 (hardest), 6, or 12 (easiest). Spaces are already displayed for you. You do not have to guess them. You cannot change the difficulty level mid-game.  Flash Card Quiz Summary \u0026ldquo;Flash Card Quiz\u0026rdquo; prompts users to identify species from a checklist using images.\nHow to play  Choose the species displayed in the image from the Name of Organism dropdown menu. Up to 5 images of the mystery species will be recalled. You can limit the images to a certain family by additionally using the Filter Quiz by Taxonomic Group dropdown menu. If you identify the species correctly, a message will alert you to this success, and one point will tally below the image. Additionally, if you identify the species correctly on your first guess, that success will also be tracked below the image. If you cannot identify a specimen, select Tell Me What It Is! and the taxon record will display for further study. Selecting Display Common Names will add common names to the species list that displays in the Name of Above Organism dropdown menu. Reset Game will reset your score to zero.  Other tips  If the images are not displaying, try using a different browser. The quiz will bring up the first image associated with the taxon record, up to a maximum of five images. The sort order of these images can be edited on the taxon record to display in a different order (see \u0026ldquo;Game administration\u0026rdquo; below).  Game administration Checklists The species displayed in each game are dependent on the contents of the selected checklist. Editing a checklist requires a portal login and possibly additional permissions depending on who created (owns) the list. You can add/remove taxa that display in games by editing checklists, if your account has permission to do so.\nImages If your account has Taxon Profile Editor permissions, you can edit which images display in the flash card quiz by changing the sort order of images in the Taxon Profile Editor, such that the images with a value of \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; will appear first, \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; second, and so on.

Thoroughly search for your institution. For example, simply searching on \u0026ldquo;ASU\u0026rdquo; will not bring up \u0026ldquo;Arizona State University\u0026rdquo;, so try all possible combinations before concluding your organization is not registered. You can also search the GBIF portal for all endorsed publishers here. ⚠️ If your organization is found in the search form, do not request endorsement. Look for the contacts listed on your organization\u0026rsquo;s publisher page. If you are unsure whether your collection should be published as a dataset in connection with this existing publisher page, reach out to the listed contacts for assistance before proceeding with data publishing. You can also ask the Support Hub for advice in this situation if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what to do. If your organization is not found in the search form, proceed with the remaining steps on this page.          It\u0026rsquo;s possible your organization is already registered as a publisher, as is often the case for museums and universities that maintain multiple natural history collections. If you determine that your organization is already registered as a publisher, reach out to the contact(s) listed on your institution\u0026rsquo;s publisher page to have them add your collection added as a separate dataset. For example, the ASU Biocollections are published to GBIF as a series of datasets.     If you have not already done so, familiarize yourself with the content on GBIF\u0026rsquo;s Become A Publisher page, which explains why the endorsement process is necessary.\n  Select \u0026ldquo;My organization is not already registered\u0026rdquo;, then review and agree to GBIF\u0026rsquo;s terms and conditions. Once you do so, a lengthier form will appear.\n  To complete the form:\nOrganizational Details:   Add your organizational details. This information may be somewhat similar to your collections profile in your Symbiota portal. However, if you are requesting endorsement for an organization that houses multiple collections that could potentially publish data to GBIF (now or in the future), this description should be more generalized. Refer to the description on the publisher page for the ASU Biocollections as an example. Use the map interface to create a placemark for your organization\u0026rsquo;s physical location.   Endorsing Node: If you are publishing your dataset through a Symbiota portal, select \u0026ldquo;Symbiota Support Hub\u0026rdquo; as your endorsing node if your collection is located in the United States. If your insitution is not US-based, please contact the GBIF-designated Node Manager for your country to see if they would like to complete your endorsement. If your country does not have a node, the Symbiota Support Hub may be able to assist with endorsement. Contact our Help Desk if you have questions about this step.\n  GBIF Projects: For most collections in Symbiota portals, the answer is \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;. Answer \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; only if you are funded through a BID project.\n  Contacts: We strongly recommend adding multiple contacts for your organization and providing at least one generic institutional email address, if possible. This will minimize the chance that your organization\u0026rsquo;s publisher page will become orphaned due to staff turnover.\n  What and How:\n   For most collections in Symbiota portals, the answer is \u0026ldquo;Occurrence-only data\u0026rdquo;. This means specimen data. In Data Description, we suggest entering something like:   I intend to publish specimen occurrences through the Consortium of Southern Rocky Mountain Herbaria, which is a Symbiota portal, available from soroherbaria.org.\n  For the remaining three questions, most collections in Symbiota portals should select \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;.   Select \u0026ldquo;Register Organization\u0026rdquo;. At this point, if you selected the Symbiota Support Hub as your endorsing node, GBIF will notify the Hub that your organization has requested endorsement as a publisher.\n  Once approved, your organization will be listed as an \u0026ldquo;Endorsed Publisher\u0026rdquo; on the Support Hub\u0026rsquo;s Participant page on GBIF.

Note that the institutional datasets can be published to GBIF using different publishing resources. For instance, the zoological collections could import their data from VertNet IPT (http://ipt.vertnet.org) or their institutional IPT, vascular plant data from the SEINet https://swbiodiversity.org, and lichens from CNALH (https://lichenportal.org).  If you are sure your institution is not yet registered, complete the registration form and follow the instructions provided by GBIF. If your institution is already registered, review the GBIF metadata for your organization and existing datasets and contact GBIF to make any necessary changes. Be sure that none of the existing datasets contain the same data you are trying to publish. If they do, make the appropriate arrangements with GBIF so that the old dataset can be archived BEFORE re-publishing the new dataset.

This type of collection is typically used by field researchers to manage their collection data and print labels prior to depositing the physical material within a collection. Even though personal collections are represented by a physical sample, they are classified as \u0026ldquo;observations\u0026rdquo; until the physical material is publicly available within a collection. Management Type - Use \u0026ldquo;Snapshot\u0026rdquo; when there is a separate in-house database maintained in the collection and the dataset within the Symbiota portal is only a periodically updated snapshot of the central database. A \u0026ldquo;Live\u0026rdquo; dataset is when the data is managed directly within the portal and the central database is the portal data. Global Unique Identifier (GUID) Source - Occurrence Id is generally used for Snapshot datasets when a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) field is supplied by the source database (e.g. Specify database) and the GUID is mapped to the occurrenceIdfield. The use of the Occurrence Id as the GUID is not recommended for live datasets. Catalog Number can be used when the value within the catalog number field is globally unique. The Symbiota Generated GUID (UUID) option will trigger the Symbiota data portal to automatically generate UUID GUIDs for each record. This option is recommended for many for Live Datasets but not allowed for Snapshot collections that are managed in local management system. iDigBio\u0026rsquo;s GUID Guide can be found here. Publishing to GBIF - Activates GBIF publishing tools available within Darwin Core Archive Publishing menu option. Icon URL - Upload an icon image file or enter the URL of an image icon that represents the collection. If entering the URL of an image already located on a server, click on \u0026ldquo;Enter URL\u0026rdquo;. The URL path can be absolute or relative. The use of icons are optional. Sort Sequence - Leave this field empty if you want the collections to sort alphabetically (default) Collection ID - Global Unique Identifier for this collection (see dwc:collectionID): If your collection already has a previously assigned GUID, that identifier should be represented here. For physical specimens, the recommended best practice is to use an identifier from a collections registry such as the Global Registry of Biodiversity Repositories.    Collection Contacts  Navigate to your Administration Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection). In the Administration Control Panel, click Contacts \u0026amp; Resources. In this tab you can change: In the Contacts \u0026amp; Resource tab, you can add links to other resources (e.g., homepages or lab pages), add or edit contact information, or add or edit the mailing address for your institution. Click a pencil icon to edit or an X icon to delete existing links/resources.

Click Edit Metadata and review the information and contacts associated with your collection. In addition to your institution/collection codes and contact information, make sure to review data usage license and GUID (see below). Contact your portal manager if you are unclear about any of the available fields.   Data Usage License: This field determines the copyright guidelines that users must follow when using your data. Many portals have predefined options that follow the Creative Commons licenses, though that can vary by portal instance. See the Creative Commons website for more information about licenses. GUID source: This designates the field that will serve as the persistent globally unique identifier (GUID) for specimen records published from the portal. (More information about the importance of GUIDs can be found in this article. You will see the following options in your portal:  Occurrence ID: This option is for collections that create their own GUID using another protocol or manage their data in an external system and map the incoming GUID to the occurrenceID field at time of import. If you manage your central data within an update-to-date Specify database, you should use this option because the import data should automatically contain a Specify-generated UUID. Darwin Core definition: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#occurrenceID. Catalog Number: You can use this option if your catalog number is configured as a globally unique identifier. See the Darwin Core occurrenceID definition above. Symbiota-generated UUID: If you are managing your data live within the Symbiota instance (e.g. the portal is your central database), this option is the easiest and most reliable method for assigning robust GUIDs to your specimen records. Even if your catalog number is configured as a unique identifier (e.g. institutionCode:collectionCode:catalogNumber format type), this is a more robust option when managing data within the portal. Do not select this option if you use the Symbiota portal to publish a snapshot of your data that is managed in another database system (e.g. Specify).    Return to your Administrator Control Panel and click “Darwin Core Archive Publishing”. Click the Create Darwin Core Archive button to build a new archive. iDigBio will periodically monitor the RSS feed that is associated with the DwC-Archive library within the portal. You should regularly refresh this archive to ensure the data within iDigBio remains current. Contact your portal manager to request automatic updates of your archive on a regular schedule.

Learn how here.\n What taxa are protected in my portal? The master list of Protected Species in a given portal can be viewed by all portal users, including those who are not logged into the portal.\n        To view all protected taxa in a portal, navigate to Sitemap \u0026gt; Collections \u0026gt; Protected Species. This example comes from SEINet.    To query records in your collection that have location security applied, use the Data Editor Search form to construct a query where \u0026quot;Location Security EQUALS 1\u0026quot;. Doing so will recall records where the location data has been obscured from public view.\n How to redact data Individually redacting locality data for certain occurrences The locality data can be redacted for individual occurrences by checking the Security box in the Occurrence Editor.\nBatch redacting locality data for certain occurrences If you wish to batch redact data, you can download a CSV file of all the specimen records you wish to redact using the Exporter tool, then add a column called \u0026ldquo;LocalitySecurity\u0026rdquo;. Enter \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; in this column for all specimens for which you wish to redact data (conversely, you would enter \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; to keep the data publicly visible, or leave this field blank). Use the Skeletal File Uploader to upload this spreadsheet into the portal, mapping the new column to localitySecurity. You may need to ask your portal manager to clear out any existing values in this field before importing via the Skeletal File Uploader.\nGlobally redacting locality data for certain taxa Locality data and images can be redacted for all occurrences by a specific taxon by someone with Super Administrator or Taxon Editor user permissions. To do this, find the species in the Taxonomic Tree Viewer or Taxonomy Explorer and open the editor (either by clicking on the taxon name or clicking the pencil next to the name). Change Locality Security from \u0026ldquo;show all locality data\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;hide locality data\u0026rdquo;.\nThis will hide locality data for all occurrences of that taxon throughout the portal, not just for your collection. Collections can opt out of this option by individually unchecking the Security box within the Occurrence Editor for individual specimen records or by contacting their portal manager for batch changes.\nRedacting data by state Finally, locality data and images can be redacted for occurrences of a given taxon that were collected in a certain state by managing a \u0026ldquo;Rare, threatened, protected species list\u0026rdquo;. User accounts with Rare Species Administrator permissions can create a species list specifically for managing sensitive species and then assigning editing rights to one of several appropriate users for populating and managing the state list. The addition of a species to the list will automatically protect locality details of all specimens collected within the designated state.\nThis will hide locality data for all occurrences of that taxon in the given state throughout the portal, not just for your collection. Collections can opt out of this option by individually unchecking the Security box within the Occurrence Editor for individual specimen records or by contacting their portal manager for batch changes.\nWill my redacted data be visible if published to GBIF? By default, no. Keep the box, \u0026ldquo;Redact Sensitive Localities\u0026rdquo;, in the Darwin Core Archive Publisher checked so that redacted data will remain obscured when a Darwin Core Archive file is sent to GBIF. To locate the Darwin Core Archive Publisher, navigate to Administration Control Panel \u0026gt; Darwin Core Archive Publishing. Scroll down to the \u0026ldquo;Create/Refresh Darwin Core Archive\u0026rdquo; box.\nKeep in mind that the Security field must contain a value of \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; for your data to be successfully redacted within the portal, as well as during data publishing; this applies to both live-managed and snapshot collections. If Security is blank, your data will remain visible and can be published.\nInstructions for creating state-based redacted species lists   Create a new empty rare species checklist.\n Click “My Profile”, select the Species Checklists tab, and click the green plus sign. Change the Checklist Type to “Rare, threatened, protected species list”. If you don’t see the Checklist Type field located below the author field, then you do not have the necessary Rare Species Administrator permissions to create this type of checklist. In this case, you can continue creating the checklist (as normal) and ask a portal manager to change the checklist type at a later date. Enter the state name in the locality field. Do not abbreviate or add any other text other than the state name. The checklist can be private or public and made available to the general public.    Add one to several checklist editors to the checklist.\n From the new checklists, click on the checklist administration editing pencil located towards the user right of the page Checklist editors do not need Rare Species Administrator or any other special editing rights to manage the list    Checklist editors add species needing protection using the normal checklist editing tools.\n See checklist tutorials for help creating and managing checklists.    How users can request access to redacted data Individuals who require access to redacted data for legitimate reasons are encouraged to directly reach out to the contact(s) listed on collections profiles to acquire data access. However, if the request is complex and requires contacting numerous collections, individuals can contact the Symbiota Support Hub for assistance in reaching out to the relevant collections. Please keep your collection\u0026rsquo;s contact information up to date so that portal users and the Support Hub can contact you about these requests. It is also recommended that you add hub@symbiota.org to your own contacts so these messages are not blocked by an institutional firewall or routed to spam.\nRelated Resources   ","tags":["rare species","data protection","redaction"],"section":"coll_manager"},{"date":"1633651200","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/redaction/","title":"Redacted and Protected Data","summary":"Some collections redact location information data (latitude/longitude and locality description) for certain specimens from the general public.

Storage of a large number of images on servers associated with a Symbiota portal (e.g., at Arizona State University) may require an image-hosting agreement and/or incur image-hosting costs. Check with the portal administrator for more information about your portal\u0026rsquo;s image hosting allowances. Otherwise, tools are available to link external URLs to occurrences by matching on catalog numbers.\nThere are three categories of images that can be linked to a Symbiota portal:\n Images of physical specimens should be linked to their respective specimen records. Specimen images are available both from the Occurrence Details page and the Taxon Profile page for the taxon associated with the most recent determination. If the specimen identification is annotated, the identification of the image will be automatically re-mapped to that taxon. Specimen images can be added through the Occurrence Editor or in batch via multiple processes. See Uploading Images for more details.  Images without specific locality information (e.g. lat/long coordinates) are linked only to the scientific name of the organism. These images can be viewed through Taxon Profile Pages, which have general information such as descriptions, distribution maps, synonyms, and common names. Field images are uploaded and managed through the Taxon Profile pages by users with Taxon Profile editing permissions. Field images with specific locality details (e.g. coordinates) can be loaded as Image Vouchers (see \"Field Images with Location\" tab). See Uploading Images for more details.  Field images with specific locality information can adequately serve as vouchers for field observations of many birds, mammals, and easy-to-identify plants. In some instances, they may actually be preferable, for instance if the organism is rare or the observer does not have the appropriate collecting permit. These images are similar to georeferenced specimen records in that they are searchable occurrence records that place a dot on the species distribution maps. There are, however, some taxonomic groups that typically require microscopic or chemical analysis for accurate identification (e.g. lichens, bryophytes, fungi). For such organisms, field images will have limited value. For this reason, some data portals might not allow the submission of observations without a physical specimen. Image Vouchers are displayed on both the Occurrence Details and the Taxon Profile pages. Image-supported observations can be uploaded using the Observation Submission page. Up to three images can be submitted for a single observation. Data fields required for an image to qualify as a voucher include: observer name, observation date, country, state, locality description, latitude, longitude, and at least one image. Contact your data portal administrator for information on whether observations are allowed and the necessary protocols for submitting an observation. Some portals require the review of a tutorial before one is authorized to submit an observation. See Uploading Images for more details.

These images can be viewed through Taxon Profile Pages, which have general information such as descriptions, distribution maps, synonyms, and common names. Field images are uploaded and managed through the Taxon Profile pages by users with Taxon Profile editing permissions. Field images with specific locality details (e.g. coordinates) can be loaded as Image Vouchers (see \"Field Images with Location\" tab). See Uploading Images for more details.  Field images with specific locality information can adequately serve as vouchers for field observations of many birds, mammals, and easy-to-identify plants. In some instances, they may actually be preferable, for instance if the organism is rare or the observer does not have the appropriate collecting permit. These images are similar to georeferenced specimen records in that they are searchable occurrence records that place a dot on the species distribution maps. There are, however, some taxonomic groups that typically require microscopic or chemical analysis for accurate identification (e.g. lichens, bryophytes, fungi). For such organisms, field images will have limited value. For this reason, some data portals might not allow the submission of observations without a physical specimen. Image Vouchers are displayed on both the Occurrence Details and the Taxon Profile pages. Image-supported observations can be uploaded using the Observation Submission page. Up to three images can be submitted for a single observation. Data fields required for an image to qualify as a voucher include: observer name, observation date, country, state, locality description, latitude, longitude, and at least one image. Contact your data portal administrator for information on whether observations are allowed and the necessary protocols for submitting an observation. Some portals require the review of a tutorial before one is authorized to submit an observation. See Uploading Images for more details.  Images of physical specimens should be linked to their respective specimen records. Specimen images are available both from the Occurrence Details page and the Taxon Profile page for the taxon associated with the most recent determination. If the specimen identification is annotated, the identification of the image will be automatically re-mapped to that taxon. Specimen images can be added through the Occurrence Editor or in batch via multiple processes. See Uploading Images for more details.

Pre-Symbiota 3.","content":"Symbiota portals serve data from specimens and observations according to regional and taxonomic themes. To search and view these data, you can use one of the tools described below.\nTable of Contents  Basic Search (pre-Symbiota 3.1) Basic Search (Symbiota 3.1 and beyond) Map Search Cross-Portal Search Quick Search  Basic Search  From the home page of the portal, click Search Collections from the top or side menu.  Pre-Symbiota 3.1 The following steps 2-5 apply to Symbiota portals that have codebases older than version 3.1. If you are using Symbiota 3.1, skip to Symbiota 3.1 and beyond\n If prompted on the next page, select or deselect collections from the provided list depending on which collections you would like to search.  If you do not wish to search specific collections, leave all the collections checked. There may be three tabs at the top of the page, \u0026ldquo;Specimens \u0026amp; Observations\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Specimens\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Observations\u0026rdquo;. Specimens are physical collections of an organism, while observations are human observations or photos of organisms that are not supported by physical specimens. Use these tabs to select between these types of occurrences, if desired.    Notice that collections may be grouped together into categories. These categories may be minimized or maximized by clicking the small grey plus or minus box, respectively, to the bottom left of the name of the group.\n Click the Search button on the far right. On the next page, you can enter search criteria to find records of interest.  The criteria you can use will vary depending on the portal, but generally include the following categories: 1) Taxonomic Criteria, 2) Locality Criteria, 3) Latitude and Longitude, 4) Collector Criteria, 5) Specimen Criteria, and 6) Trait Criteria (if enabled). Any number of criteria can be entered and search at the same time. You can search for multiple values in a single field by separating the values by commas. For example, if you want to search by both Kern and Inyo counties, you should enter \u0026ldquo;Kern,Inyo\u0026rdquo; in the county field. Latitude and Longitude: To define a latitude/longitude bounding box, polygon, or point with radius in which to search, enter the values in the provided fields or click the Mapping Aid icon to create the box, shape, or point radius in the Leaflet mapping interface. Specimen Criteria: If enabled for your portal, this search category may contain a dropdown list to query materialSampleType. Further documentation on the Material Sample module can be found here.   Click List Display to conduct the search and view results as a list, or click Table Display to conduct the search and view results in a table.  List Display\nTable Display\nTo return to the Search Criteria page and refine your search, click Search Criteria from the navigation menu at the top of the page.\n To view the results in a table or to sort the search results, click the Table Display button. In the Search Results box at the top of the page, select the field you would like to sort by, a second field you would like to sort by (if applicable), then whether you would like to sort results in ascending or descending order. Then click Sort.\n Symbiota 3.1 and beyond The following steps 2-3 apply to Symbiota portals that have codebases that are version 3.1 or higher. If you are using a version prior to Symbiota 3.1, return to to Pre-Symbiota 3.1 instructions.\n On the next page, you can enter search criteria to find records of interest. Click the Expand All Sections button if you would like to see all of the possible criteria you can search on.   The criteria you can use will vary depending on the portal, but generally include the following categories: 1) Taxonomic Criteria, 2) Locality Criteria, 3) Latitude and Longitude, 4) Collector Criteria, 5) Specimen Criteria, and 6) Trait Criteria (if enabled). Any number of criteria can be entered and search at the same time. The criteria you are searching by will show up as \u0026ldquo;chips\u0026rdquo; on the right side of the screen under \u0026ldquo;Criteria.\u0026rdquo; Click the X on any of these chips to remove them from your search criteria. You can search for multiple values in a single field by separating the values by commas. For example, if you want to search by both Kern and Inyo counties, you should enter \u0026ldquo;Kern,Inyo\u0026rdquo; in the county field. Latitude and Longitude: To define a latitude/longitude bounding box, polygon, or point with radius in which to search, enter the values in the provided fields or click the appropriate button at the top of the Latitude \u0026amp; Longitude search criteria to create the box, shape, or point radius in the mapping interface. Sample Properties: Here you can search by catalog number or limit your search criteria to only include records that are types (i.e., have a value in the TypeStatus field), records that have media, records that have genetic data, records that are georeferenced, or records that have material samples (if enabled in your portal). You can also opt to include cultivated or captive records in this criterion category. Trait Criteria: Here you can limit your search to include only records with certain values of trait criteria. Note that the search will only be able to provide you with records that have been scored for those particular traits, and the absence of a certain trait value applied to a specimen does not necessarily indicate that a trait value does not apply to a record. Furthermore, the record is an \u0026ldquo;OR\u0026rdquo; search. Selecting multiple trait values will return all records with at least one of those traits.  Click the Search button on the far right to conduct your search.  To return to the Search Criteria page and refine your search, click the \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; button in your browser.\n To view the results in a table or to sort the search results, click the Table Display button. In the Search Results box at the top of the page, select the field you would like to sort by, a second field you would like to sort by (if applicable), then whether you would like to sort results in ascending or descending order. Then click Sort. To switch back to list view, click the List Display button.  Map Search Depending on the portal, the Map Search function may be under the Search Collections menu item, or listed as a separate menu item on the homepage.\nClick the Open Search Panel button in the top left corner. Once open, you can enter the same types of criteria into this search panel as were available in the regular search (described above). Then click the Search button.\nTo select specific collections from which you would like to search, select the Collections tab in the search panel, then check or uncheck boxes next to collections as desired.\nFurther customizations can be made in the Map Options tab of the search panel including grid size and min. cluster size. These will affect how many specimens will be clustered together on the map. You can also turn off clustering in this tab.\nOnce you have conducted a search, you can view a list of specimens by clicking the Open Search Panel button and viewing the Records and Taxa menu item. You can also download the specimen records, download a KML file of the specimen records, or generate a shareable link to these search results by clicking on the respective buttons on this page.\nCross-Portal Search (not available in all portals) Some portals include the ability to search not only in the portal database, but also in the database of another, connected Symbiota portal. This option is only available in the Map Search interface.\nTo use this feature, navigate to the Map Search in your portal and check the box next to \u0026ldquo;Enable Cross Portal Search\u0026rdquo;. You will then see a dropdown list of the available portals to search and new \u0026ldquo;Taxa\u0026rdquo; field. Select the desired portal (there will likely only be one) and enter the name of the taxon or taxa that you would like to search in the other portal. The \u0026ldquo;Taxa\u0026rdquo; field at the very top of the form will reference your current portal\u0026rsquo;s taxonomic thesaurus, while the \u0026ldquo;Taxa\u0026rdquo; field under the Cross Portal Search option will reference the taxonomic thesaurus of the other portal (the one selected in the dropdown list).\nThe resulting map will include results from both portals you have searched. The dots will be colored by taxon by default. To color the dots by portal, click the Portal List tab and click the Auto Color button.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Records\u0026rdquo; tab will list all the records from the portal you are in, and the \u0026ldquo;External Records\u0026rdquo; tab will list all the records from the outside portal that you are also searching.\nQuick Search Using Quick Search forms, you can search for multiple taxa (scientificName values) or, where applicable, Catalog Number values by listing your search criteria in a semi-colon delimited list, e.g. \u0026ldquo;Rosa abietorum;Rosa alba\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;100;1000\u0026rdquo;.\n By portal Some Symbiota portals feature a portal-wide taxon quick search form on their homepage. Use this form to search for all specimen records in the portal that are linked to the portal\u0026rsquo;s central taxonomic thesaurus by typing directly into the form and then selecting the \u0026ldquo;Search\u0026rdquo; button. If you begin typing a scientific name in this box and a dropdown list does not appear (shown below), then the taxon you are searching for does not exist in the portal\u0026rsquo;s taxonomic thesaurus. By collection Similar to the portal-wide quick search forms described above, some Symbiota portals feature quick search forms on Collection Profiles to facilitate searching for records limited to individual datasets. Currently, these forms can be used to search within a given Collection Profile by Catalog Number or Scientific Name (Taxon).\n","tags":["search","specimens","observations"],"section":"user"},{"date":"1637539200","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/label/","title":"Label Customization and Printing","summary":"This page describes how to access and use the label printing functions in a Symbiota portal.\n For instructions on printing specimen packets, see this page\n   Printing Specimen Labels To print specimen labels, navigate to the Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection) and click “Print Labels/Annotations.” Search for the desired specimens by entering search terms in one or many of the available fields in the “Define Specimen Recordset” box and clicking “Filter Specimen Records.","content":" This page describes how to access and use the label printing functions in a Symbiota portal.\n For instructions on printing specimen packets, see this page\n   Printing Specimen Labels To print specimen labels, navigate to the Data Editor Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of collection) and click “Print Labels/Annotations.” Search for the desired specimens by entering search terms in one or many of the available fields in the “Define Specimen Recordset” box and clicking “Filter Specimen Records.” Select all the specimens for which you want to print labels by checking or unchecking the boxes in the leftmost column of the table. Use the “Select/Deselect all Specimens” box to check or uncheck all the boxes as necessary.\nIn the Label Printing box, select the name of the “Label Profile” that you wish to apply to your printed labels. The label profile will specify which fields are printed and the aesthetics of the label. Default (simple) profiles can be found in the “Portal defined profiles” list, and you can select your own saved profile from the “User defined profiles” list. Instructions for defining a label profile are described in the next section. After selecting a profile, you can then enter a desired heading (e.g., “Robert F. Hoover Herbarium (OBI)”, heading mid-section (e.g., state or family), heading suffix (any additional text information), and label footer (e.g., the name of the project for which the specimen was collected) for all labels to be printed. You can also select from a number of other options in the “Label Printing” box including whether you want to print the specimen barcode.\nOnce you have selected your desired options, you can print the labels directly from your browser, export the specimen data to a CSV file (similar to an Excel file, this format can be used with mail merge to produce labels), or export the labels to a Word document (DOCX file) by clicking the appropriate button. Note that currently, Word (DOCX) output only generates the old static label format (the “label profile” settings will not be applied). If you click “Print in Browser”, you can manually edit the label content by clicking the Edit Labels Content button in the top right corner.\nCustomize Label Format To create a new label profile that will apply custom formatting to your printed labels, click the pencil icon to the right of Label Profiles (highlighted below).\nThen click the green plus sign in the User Profiles box. Enter the title of the user profile and any desired header and footer information. Select the desired options from the Options box.\nTo further customize the label, click “visual interface” to the right of the “JSON” header. The resulting page will allow you to tailor your label with more detail (see next screenshot).\nThe format of your label is represented in the grey “Label Content Area” box. This is where you will build the label format. To add fields to your label, drag and drop field names from the left hand list of buttons into the “Label Content Area”. As you do this, a preview of the label format will appear in the Label Preview box. Note that you can add as many lines as desired in the Label Content Area by clicking the Add Line button. By clicking on one of the fields that you have added to the Label Content Area, you can also add a prefix or suffix, change the font format, change the size, change the font, and move the position of the field by altering these elements under the Field Options section (highlighted in screenshot below). You can also change the options for an entire line by clicking the line in the Label Content Area (it will turn green) and then editing the options under the Line Options section.\n","tags":["labels","printing"],"section":"editor"},{"date":"1638921600","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/links/","title":"Linking Records/Resources","summary":"This page describes how to link single associated occurrences, checklists, duplicates, or genetic resources with occurrence records.

Contact your portal manager if you do not already have a collection in your desired Symbiota portal.\n Upload Types There are several options for uploading data into a Symbiota portal:\n Full Text File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a comma-separated value (CSV) or tab-separated value (TSV) file containing ALL fields of your occurrence data.","content":" This page provides instructions for uploading data into an existing collection in a Symbiota portal. Contact your portal manager if you do not already have a collection in your desired Symbiota portal.\n Upload Types There are several options for uploading data into a Symbiota portal:\n Full Text File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a comma-separated value (CSV) or tab-separated value (TSV) file containing ALL fields of your occurrence data. You can convert an Excel document into a CSV file by clicking Save As, then selecting comma-delimited (CSV) from the file types. Note that, if data exists in the portal for any of the occurrences you are uploading, those data will be overwritten by the incoming data. To upload partial records, use a Skeletal File Upload. Skeletal File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a CSV or TSV file containing data from only a few fields (e.g., georeferences or other ancillary data). Note that this upload type can only fill in fields that are currently empty in the portal. The data provided in a skeletal file upload will NOT overwrite existing data in the database, so any pre-existing data in the desired fields must be deleted if you wish to replace it with the data from the skeletal file. Darwin Core Archive Manual Upload: Use this upload type if the data you wish to upload is in the format of a Darwin Core Archive. A Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) is a data standard that is commonly used to package species occurrence data into a single, self-contained dataset. A DwC-A includes metadata, a file of occurrence data, and, often, files for determinations (identifications) and images. IPT Resource / Darwin Core Archive Provider: Use this upload type if you will provide a URL to an existing Darwin Core Archive published on the web, such as one provided through an IPT. NfN File Upload: Use this upload type if you will provide a CSV file produced from Notes from Nature. Direct Database Mapping: Stored Procedure: Use this option if you are transferring from a source schema to a Symbiota database located on the same MySQL database server. Script Upload: Use this option if you are transferring from a MySQL source to Symbiota database that is located on a different server.  Initiating the Upload  Navigate to your Administration Control Panel (My Profile \u0026gt; Occurrence Management \u0026gt; name of your collection). Click Import/Update Specimen Records, then select \u0026ldquo;Create a new Import Profile\u0026rdquo;. Create a title for your upload in the Title field. Select the desired Upload Type from the dropdown menu (see Upload Types section above). Follow the directions below according to the Upload Type you have selected.  File Upload or Skeletal File Upload A Full Text File Upload will use the incoming data to overwrite all existing occurrence data in the database, even for fields that are not included in the upload file. For example, if your database contains a \u0026ldquo;country\u0026rdquo; field, but your input file does not have the \u0026ldquo;country\u0026rdquo; field, after upload, the \u0026ldquo;country\u0026rdquo; field will be blank. After a Full Text File Upload, the only data associated with your specimens in the occurrence editor will be the data that were in the upload file. Conversely, a Skeletal File Upload will only import data into fields that are empty. It will not replace existing values within fields.\n  If you or your portal manager have created a Stored Procedure with data cleaning or other checks, enter the name of the stored procedure in the provided field. Otherwise, ignore this step. Click the Create Profile button. On the next page, you will see a list of existing upload profiles. Select the profile that you wish to use (the one you just greated) and click Initialize Upload.  To edit your upload profile in the future, you can click the pencil icon on this page.   Click the Choose File button and navigate to the file that you wish to upload in your File Manager or Finder window. Select that file and click Open. Click the Analyze File button. If the collection to which you are uploading data is live managed (the portal is your database system), proceed to step 7. If the collection to which you are uploading data is a “snapshot” of a specimen database managed within the home institution, select the primary key for the source specimen record from the dropdown menu. The primary key is a required field for snapshot datasets that will serve as the primary record identifier (the permanent link between the source database and the portal records). This field must be populated for every record with unique values. These values must also be stable and not changed in the central database over time. Snapshots will typically use the catalog number (accession number), barcode, or database primary key from the source database specimen table for this field. You will then see a page that will look similar to the one shown below. The length and contents of the Source Field/Target Field table will depend on what columns were included in the original CSV file.  Select which fields in your CSV file (Source Fields) will correspond to which fields in the Symbiota portal (Target Fields). Check the Symbiota Data Field Guide for definitions of each data field. Also see the Uploading Tips section below. Once you are satisfied with your field-to-field mapping (see next Notes), click the “Save Mapping” button. Select whether you would like the script to match the data in your file to existing data in the portal based on Catalog Number or Other Catalog Numbers. You will only need to do this if you are adding data to records that already exist in the portal. Otherwise, leave these unchecked. Select the Processing Status that you would like to apply to all your uploaded records (if desired) by selecting an option from the dropdown menu. Click the Start Upload button. This will upload your data into a temporary table so you can review it before committing the final upload. Verify that the correct number of records are being updated and/or added by viewing the Pending Data Transport Report on the next page.  View the data that have been stored in the temporary table to ensure correct mapping and formatting of the fields you are uploading. You can either:  Click the small box icon to the right of \u0026ldquo;Records to be updated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;New records\u0026rdquo; to view the records in a table in your browser. Click the multiple file icon to the right of the box icon to download a CSV file of the records to be updated or new records.   If anything is incorrect, fix your CSV file and re-upload it according to the steps you followed above, or return to your field mapping and fix the field mapping. If everything looks good, click the Transfer Records to Central Specimen Table button. Note that this step is final and is not possible to undo!  Darwin Core Archive Manual Upload Use this import profile when you are manually uploading a Darwin Core Archive. Rather than matching on catalog number or other catalog number, this import profile will match on the internal \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; field of the incoming Darwin Core Archive. This \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; field is then stored in the \u0026ldquo;dbpk\u0026rdquo; field in the occurrence table and will be used for future updating of the data. For this reason, it is very important that the \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; values do not change between subsequent uploads of your Darwin Core Archive. It is best practice to use a globally unique identifier (e.g., whatever is used as your occurrenceID) for this field.\nIf you have already created an import profile, or if you have been instructed to use an existing import profile, click \u0026ldquo;Saved Import Profiles\u0026rdquo; under the \u0026ldquo;Import/Update Specimen Records\u0026rdquo; option, then skip to step 5.\n Enter a name for your upload in the Title field. If you or your portal manager have created a Stored Procedure with data cleaning or other checks, enter the name of the stored procedure in the provided field. Otherwise, ignore this step. Click Create Profile. Select the radio button for the name of the profile you would like to use for your import (if you just created an import profile, use that one). Click the Initialize Upload button. Click the Choose File button and select the Darwin Core Archive (packaged as a zip file) that you would like to upload. Then click the Analyze File button. On the resulting page, you will have the option to view and/or verify the mappings of the incoming (1) occurrences file, (2) identification history file (if it exists), and (3) images file (if it exists). If one or more of these files does not exist in the incoming DwC-A, the checkbox to the left of it will be grayed out. To view or verify the mappings, click \u0026ldquo;view details\u0026rdquo; to the right of the file you wish to view.   Because the incoming file is aligned with Darwin Core, you will not likely need to change the mappings of this file. However, it is a good idea to check the fields. Check the Symbiota Data Field Guide for definitions of each data field. Also see the Uploading Tips section below.\n  Once you are satisfied with your field-to-field mapping, click the “Save Mapping” button.\n  If you want all the incoming data to be assigned a specific processing status, select that processing status value from the dropdown menu. If not, leave the processing status as \u0026ldquo;Leave as is / No Explicit Setting\u0026rdquo;.\n  Click the Start Upload button.\n  View the data that have been stored in the temporary table to ensure correct mapping and formatting of the fields you are uploading. You particularly want to make sure that the number of new records versus updated records matches your expectations. A large number of new records, if you did not expect them, may indicate that your \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; field changed since the last upload. To view the mapping of your fields, you can:\n Click the small box icon to the right of \u0026ldquo;Records to be updated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;New records\u0026rdquo; to view the records in a table in your browser. Click the multiple file icon to the right of the box icon to download a CSV file of the records to be updated or new records.    You may also see that there are records that exist in your Symbiota portal that are not found in the incoming data. Note that these records will not automatically be deleted from the Symbiota portal. If you deleted these records in your home database or IPT provider, you will need to manually delete them in your Symbiota portal as well. For bulk deletions, contact your portal administrator.\nIf anything is incorrect, return to the Saved Import Profiles, re-initiate the upload, and fix your mappings. If everything looks good, click the Transfer Records to Central Specimen Table button. Note that this step is final and is not possible to undo!  IPT Resource / Darwin Core Archive Provider Use this import profile when you are importing from an IPT or other source that provides a URL to a Darwin Core Archive. Follow the steps outlined for Darwin Core Archive Manual Upload above, but instead of uploading a Darwin Core Archive as a zip file in Step 6, you will need to provide a URL to the IPT or Darwin Core Archive provider in the \u0026ldquo;path\u0026rdquo; field during Step 2. If you are bringing data in from an IPT, the URL will look something like this (with a different base URL): https://fmipt.fieldmuseum.org/ipt/archive.do?r=fmnh_seedplants. This URL is also sometimes referred to as the Darwin Core Archive \u0026ldquo;endpoint\u0026rdquo; for a dataset.\nThe same cautions as a manual Darwin Core Archive upload apply to this upload type.\nStored Procedure  Write a stored procedure used to transfer records (the collection cleanup scripts can be put in central stored procedure or kept separate) Set up the script to run as a regular cronjob.  Script Upload  Write a stored procedure used to transfer records. A sample Linux script is located here: SampleSystemUpload.sh. The cleanup scripts can be put in central stored procedure or kept separate. Set up the script to run as a regular cronjob.  Uploading Tips A list of fields that can be imported into a Symbiota data portal can be found here.\n If you\u0026rsquo;re new to using data ingestion tools in Symbiota portals, start by uploading a small number of records before ingesting larger datasets. You will be able to delete erroneous records one-by-one, but not in batch.\n  To take advantage of the Tag Name + Identifier system (in which you can tag an identifier/other catalog number with a specific title), enter the tag name followed by a colon and then the identifier value, e.g., \u0026ldquo;Old Accession Number: 12345\u0026rdquo;. For multiple identifiers, separate the tag name + identifiers by semicolons, e.g., \u0026ldquo;NP #: 4321; Accession #: 9876\u0026rdquo; If the scientific names in your CSV file include taxonomic authorship (e.g., Acer circinatum Pursh), map this field to the Target Field “scientificname.” If the scientific names included in your CSV file do NOT include taxonomic authorship (e.g., Acer circinatum), map this field to “sciname.” Collection dates mapped to eventDate will be evaluated and validated. Illegal dates will be placed in the verbatimEventDate field. The majority of the standard date formats are accepted, including Gregorian dates and Excel numeric date format (US only). eventDate will be generated from separate year,month, and day field values. If month or day fields are left null, ’00’ values will be used (ex: 1954-03-00, 1965-00-00). Month field values can be numeric or text (English or Spanish). Scripts attempt to extract valid date values from verbatimEventDate field when the eventDate field is null. Values of ’00’ are used for missing month or day (ex: 1954-03-00, 1965-00-00) If your elevation field is not consistently in meters, map it to the verbatimElevation field. Elevations in feet will be converted to meters as long as the units are specified in the field. Coordinate values:  Upon upload, background scripts will attempt to extract lat/long coordinate values from the verbatimCoordinates field. The field is evaluated for DMS and UTM formats, which are converted to decimal latitude and longitude. If you have lat/long in a single field, you can map this field to verbatimCoordinates, and decimal latitude and longitude fields will be automatically parsed. If you have UTM coordinates in multiple fields, map the fields (northing, easting, zone) to their matching UTM fields (utmnorthing, utmeasting, utmzone). This will instigate conversion of UTM coordinates to decimal latitude and longitude. The values will additionally be stored in the verbatiumCoordinates field. If you have UTM coordinates in a single field, map this field to utmnorthing and leave other UTM fields null in order to direct scripts to parse using only the UTM parser. TRS coordinates (Public Lands Survey System) can be entered as a single field into verbatimCoordinates, or into separate fields (trstownship, trsrange, trssection, trssectiondetails); however, these coordinates will not be automatically converted into decimal degrees due to potential differences in interpretation. See the georeferencing section of this guide (coming soon) for information about converting TRS coordinates to decimal degrees.

This module is activated on a per-collection basis (i.e. not per portal) and appears as an additional form within the Occurrence Editor. Contact your portal administrator to have this module activated for your collection.\nGeochronologic/Chronostratigraphic Data Controlled Vocabularies The values for the geochonologic/chronostratigraphic terms in the paleo module rely on a suggested controlled vocabulary, which is in place to facilitate consistent data entry when records are manually created in your portal.\nIf your portal community has not yet selected a standard upon which to base this controlled vocabulary, recommended options include:\n The International Commission on Stratigraphy\u0026rsquo;s Chronostratigraphic Chart The Geological Society of America\u0026rsquo;s Geologic Time Scale The US Geological Survey\u0026rsquo;s Divisions of Geological Time  Bulk Importing \u0026amp; Manipulating Age-Related Values If the paleo module has been activated for your collection\u0026rsquo;s profile in a Symbiota portal, data can be imported, downloaded, and batch updated using the same methods for non-paleo collections. Refer to the documentation on Importing and Uploading Data for more information.\nWhen bulk ingesting data that includes values destined for the Eon, Era, Period, Epoch and/or Stage fields, be aware of the idiosyncrasies illustrated below:\n        Only one hierarchy for age-related data can be specified within the Occurrence Editor. In other words, if a specimen\u0026rsquo;s possible age may span multiple divisions of geologic time\u0026ndash;e.g. Early Interval=\u0026ldquo;Campanian\u0026rdquo; and Late Interval=\u0026ldquo;Danian\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;at present, you can only specify one hierarchy using the Paleo Module form. In the example above, the hierachy for \u0026ldquo;Danian\u0026rdquo; is selected. However, full hierarchies for both Late Interval and Early Interval can be bulk uploaded after cataloging, if desired.            ⚠️ While a controlled vocabulary exists, it is only suggested; therefore, illogical age values can be keystroked and saved the Occurrence Editor. In the example above, because “Lower Cretaceous” exists as value for Epoch, the form accepted this value, even though it\u0026rsquo;s an illogical choice for Stage = “Maastrichtian”).            ❗A \u0026ldquo;mismatched term\u0026rdquo; error will appear if an entered value does not perfectly align with your portal\u0026rsquo;s suggested controlled vocabulary in the Eon, Era, Period, Epoch and Stage fields. In this example, the suggested vocabulary prefers \u0026ldquo;Upper Cretaceous\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Late Cretaceous\u0026rdquo;; therefore, when \u0026ldquo;Late Cretaceous\u0026rdquo; is entered, an error appears. This error is only visible on the Occurence Editor interface and will not affect how your data are stored, exported, or displayed publicly.    Entering BasisOfRecord At present, the default value for basisOfRecord in Symbiota portals is \u0026ldquo;PreservedSpecimen\u0026rdquo;; however, the correct value for paleontological occurrences is \u0026ldquo;FossilSpecimen\u0026rdquo;. This value can be manually selected in the Occurrence Editor form during cataloging, or by batch editing to replace \u0026ldquo;PreservedSpecimen\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;FossilSpecimen\u0026rdquo; after cataloging is complete.\nFossil Localities/Sites At present, locality (site) data are entered at the specimen occurence level\u0026ndash;i.e., on a record-by-record basis\u0026ndash;in Symbiota portals. Locality data are also publicly visible by default. Refer to the documentation on locality redaction for instructions on how to obscure this information for sensitive localities.\nExtinct Taxa Extinct taxa are supported in Symbiota. Refer to the Taxonomy Tree Viewer in Pteridoportal for examples.\nData Publishing Considerations At present, while Symbiota supports paleontological data, including the Darwin Core Class GeologicalContext, values in these fields do not export within Darwin Core archives when published to GBIF via Symbiota portals. However, this information can be exported as part of a backup file.\nPrinting Labels Similar to data publishing, values in the Darwin Core Class GeologicalContext are not currently available within the label editor\u0026rsquo;s visual interface.

The default values available for this field are:\n Unprocessed Unprocessed/NLP Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Pending Review-nfn Pending Review Expert Required Reviewed Closed  There are no standard definitions for these status values. Collaborative digitization projects will often define processing status values in a way that helps them manage their workflows and reporting (e.g., see Appendix 2 in this document from the California Phenology Network).\nProcessing Status integrates with the following tools in Symbiota portals:\n Crowdsourcing module: when Processing Status=\u0026ldquo;Unprocessed\u0026rdquo; and a record has at least one associated image, it is available to be added to the Crowdsourcing queue. Reports: the numbers of records per processing status can be quickly viewed by a collection administrator through the Reports tab of the Processing Toolbox.  The Processing Status can also be batch edited and searched using Data Editor Search Form (Data Editor Control Panel \u0026gt; Edit Existing Occurrence Records):\nEditing Processing Status Processing Status and Status Auto-Set are located under the Curation section of the Occurrence Editor form: Manually Processing Status can be manually updated from within the Curation box on the Occurrence Editor. This method is most useful when making on-off edits to records that do not require extensive workflow tracking.\nDo not use the Status Auto-Set field if you want to change the processing status for a single record! Make sure you are using the Processing Status field inside the Curation box.\n Automatically The Status Auto-Set menu is used for making changes to Processing Status when multiple records are to be edited. If a user needs to edit numerous records, but they do not want to remember to manually update the Processing Status as they work, Status Auto-Set can be used to automatically update this field, for example, during image transcription. Once Status Auto-Set is set, any records a user subsequently edits will receive that new Processing Status value.\nStatus Auto-Set is user-specific and relies on browser cookies to function.\n ","tags":["crowdsourcing","transcription","editing"],"section":"editor"},{"date":"1646006400","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/fields/catno/","title":"Catalog Numbers","summary":"Catalog Numbers Catalog numbers are important to assign to each record because they act as unique identifiers for each record. This field should be used to store the barcode or the accession number (herbaria only). This field should be unique for each collection, for example, by including the collection acronym (e.g., ASU00012345, WIS-L-001456). Use of leading zeros is recommended to enable correct sorting in the Symbiota interface.\nTag Name / Additional Identifier Values (= Other Catalog Numbers) Because specimens may be associated with multiple catalog numbers / identifiers, Symbiota portals have a tool that allows multiple values for Other Catalog Number.","content":"Catalog Numbers Catalog numbers are important to assign to each record because they act as unique identifiers for each record. This field should be used to store the barcode or the accession number (herbaria only). This field should be unique for each collection, for example, by including the collection acronym (e.g., ASU00012345, WIS-L-001456). Use of leading zeros is recommended to enable correct sorting in the Symbiota interface.\nTag Name / Additional Identifier Values (= Other Catalog Numbers) Because specimens may be associated with multiple catalog numbers / identifiers, Symbiota portals have a tool that allows multiple values for Other Catalog Number. In the Occurrence Editor, this tool is located to the right of the Catalog Number field, and it includes boxes for \u0026ldquo;Tag Names\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Additional Identifier Values\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Tag Name field is an optional field that can be used to label the type of identifier being applied to the specimen. Tag Names are generally collection-specific (i.e., there are no recommended values). Common tags may include: Previous Catalog Number, Old Catalog #, Accession Number, NPS #, NPS Accession #, Secondary OccurrenceID, etc. The Tag Name field can be left blank if you do not wish to label the type of Other Catalog Number / Identifier.\nThe Additional Identifier Value field is where you can enter the alphanumeric value of the Other Catalog Number / Additional Identifier. For example, if you have an old accession number of 45678, you can enter \u0026ldquo;Accession #\u0026rdquo; in the Tag Name field, and 45678 into the Additional Identifier Value field. Alternatively, you can leave Tag Name blank and only enter a value into the Additional Identifier Value field.\nThese tools were released in March 2022 and are under active development. For this reason, some functionalities are still coming online. In particular, searching based on Other Catalog Numbers may produce incomplete results until all values of Other Catalog Number are transferred into the new Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system.\n How do I search for Other Catalog Numbers?    Values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field in the table display of a regular search. Because the Tag Name and Additional Identifier Value fields are separated, you can search for values of Other Catalog Number without having to include the tag name of the identifier. For example, if you search for Other Catalog Number \u0026ldquo;12345\u0026rdquo;, the results would include things like \u0026ldquo;Accession #: 12345\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;NPS #: 12345\u0026rdquo;. The search will be conducted based off of the number/value rather than the tag name.   What is the difference between the Other Catalog Number field and the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system?    On the technical side, the Other Catalog Number field was a single text field, and the new Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value is a new table in the Symbiota schema (i.e., database structure). However, to a user, the function of these two systems are essentially the same. The Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system was created to facilitate smarter searching for values of Other Catalog Number. Values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field in the table display of a regular search. The Tag Name (if it exists) is listed first, followed by a colon, then the Additional Identifier Value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765). If there are multiple identifiers, they are concatenated into the Other Catalog Number field and separated by semicolons (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765; Voucher Number: 12345).   How are Tag Names and Additional Identifier Values displayed in a search?    Values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field in the table display of a regular search. The Tag Name (if it exists) is listed first, followed by a colon, then the Additional Identifier Value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765). If there are multiple identifiers, they are concatenated into the Other Catalog Number field and separated by semicolons (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765; Voucher Number: 12345).   How are Tag Names and Additional Identifier Values displayed in a data download?    Just like when you conduct a search on the Other Catalog Numbers field, values entered in the Tag Name + Additional Identifier Value system are displayed in the Other Catalog Number field. The Tag Name (if it exists) is listed first, followed by a colon, then the Additional Identifier Value (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765). If there are multiple identifiers, they are concatenated into the Other Catalog Numbers field and separated by semicolons (e.g., \u0026ldquo;NPS Accession #: 98765; Voucher Number: 12345). This is also how the data are presented in a Darwin Core Archive.

Option A: To apply batch changes to all records, click on “Display Table” in the Record Search Form, then click the Batch Edit button above the resulting table of all records from your collection. Continue to step 3.   In older versions of Symbiota, the batch edit button was an icon like this:  Option B: To apply batch changes to a subset of records, first search for the records of interest using the search form. Once you have the set of records to which you would like to make a batch edit, click the Batch Edit Button at the top of your selected table of records.\nFrom the dropdown menu next to \u0026ldquo;Field Name\u0026rdquo; in Batch Update, select the field you want to edit.  In \u0026ldquo;Current Value:\u0026rdquo; enter the text that is presently in the field you want to edit. In \u0026ldquo;New Value\u0026rdquo; enter the text that you want to be in the edited field. Choose if you want to match the whole field or just match any part. Click “Batch Update Field” to enact your batch edit. A pop-up screen will tell you the number of records to be updated, warn you that the replace operation cannot be undone, and prompt you to OK the update. Proceed with caution and see examples below.  ⚠️ It is easy to inadvertently change text you did not intend to change. Generally, the more specific your \u0026ldquo;Current Value:\u0026rdquo; text, the less likely you are to run into unintended consequences. If possible, get an estimate from your record table of how many records should be affected, and check that against the number of records cited in the warning. If the numbers do not match, rethink your strategy.\nIt is not possible to check the record count when sorting by \u0026ldquo;Modified By\u0026rdquo; first. Doing so returns a count of the number of fields edited by the \u0026ldquo;Modified By\u0026rdquo; user for all records to be affected, rather than the number of records to be affected.\n Examples ✅ Example of a good use of batch edit: Standardizing plant collector names. If you are standardizing all Wherry’s collections to “Edgar T. Wherry,” then you could enter “E. T. Wherry” in Current Value and “Edgar T. Wherry” in New Value in batch edit for the collector field name, and update. Repeat for alternate forms of this name (e.g., “E T Wherry,” Edgar T Wherry”).\n❌ Example of a bad use of batch edit: Changing cardinal directions. For example, if you entered “n.” in Current Value and “N” in New Value in batch edit for the locality in an attempt to change lower case abbreviated instances of the cardinal direction north, you would accomplish that, but you would also change any other character string with “n.” such as a sentence ending in the letter n. This would result in batch misplacements of “N” where “n.” should be. For example, “Next to the station. East side” would be transformed into “Next to the statioN East side.”\n","tags":["batch","edit","change","record search form"],"section":"coll_manager"},{"date":"1635310925","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/dev/","title":"Developer Guide","summary":"Learn to edit and develop Symbiota code","content":"Coming soon!\n","tags":[],"section":"dev"},{"date":"1635206400","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/tabs/","title":"Record Editor Tabs","summary":"This page explains the tabs at the top of the Occurrence Editor tool.\n Upon opening the Record Editor page, you will see 4-5 tabs, depending on your level of permissions.

This field is enforced to be unique per collection\nEx: WIS-L-0123456, ASU0012345, 12345\nSee Darwin Core's catalogNumber Additional Identifier Values: Any other identifier for a specimen record that is not the central catalog number. This field is typically used to store the old catalog numbers, accession numbers, National Park identifiers, etc. Identifiers can be assigned a tag name to distinguish it from other identifiers (e.g. old accession #, NPS#, etc). These identifiers map best to dwc:otherCatalogNumbers definition, and thus included in the exports under this field. More information about this system can be found on the Catalog Numbers documentation page.\nEx: 12345, TUZI 3082, NPS Acc #: GUIS-M-00126.\nSee Darwin Core\u0026rsquo;s otherCatalogNumbers\n Collector:  The name of the person who collected the specimen or made the observation.\nEx: C.G.

This is typically done because the species is rare or threatened. Images are also hidden to protect locality details that might be viewable from the label. Users that are logged into the system and have the necessary permission to view locality details (e.g. collection managers) will continue to have access to all data. This box will automatically be checked if the species name is on any of the rare species lists (see sitemap). If one wishes to lock protection (on or off), click the Lock Security checkbox and/or enter a reason for security override in the text field. Leaving the locality security unlocked will allow default settings to be applied as determined by the sensitive species administrators, which is the recommendation for most records. For more information on sensitive species protection, see the page on Sensitive Species Protection. This field is not defined by the Darwin Core standard.\n Location Remarks:  Comments or notes about the locality\nEx: Previously known as Mt. Evans\nSee Darwin Core's locationRemarks  Latitude and Longitude (decimal format):  The geographic latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. Latitudes from the southern hemisphere and longitudes in the western hemisphere (e.g. USA) should be entered as negative values. Click on the \u0026#34;Tools\u0026#34; button to enter the coordinates in the degree, minute, seconds (DMS) or the UTM formats. Decimal degrees are the preferred coordinate standard as defined by Darwin Core. See below for more information on using this tool.\nEx: 34.874022, -111.75774\nSee Darwin Core's decimalLatitude  Uncertainty (meters):  The accuracy of the georeference coordinates in meters (numeric value only). This is measured as the radius of a circle where the true point would be found if known. If coordinates are collected using a GPS, than the accuracy would be the error found within the GPS unit (usually around 10m). While previously collected specimens that have coordinates on the label recorded by the collector typically do not state the source of the coordinates (GPS, map, etc), it is typically a good assumption that the coordinates are accurate within one to two hundred meters. If the locality details are vague such as just \u0026#34;Grand Canyon\u0026#34;, then the coordinates should be the centroid within the uncertainty encompassing the greater area where the specimen may have been collected. If the locality is \u0026#34;Boynton Canyon, Sedona\u0026#34;, the uncertainty would be about 1500 m. This field autofills when using GeoLocate for georeferencing.\nEx: 42000 for Phoenix, 20000 for Salt Lake City\nSee Darwin Core's coordinateUncertaintyInMeters  Datum:  The geographic system that was used to get the coordinates.

If your coordinates are in \u0026ldquo;degrees, minutes, seconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;UTM\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;township-range-section\u0026rdquo; (TRS) format, click the \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; button to view the formatting tools. Fill in the appropriate box with the coordinates on your label and click the Insert Values button. Valid values in \u0026ldquo;degrees-minutes-seconds\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;UTM\u0026rdquo; formats will be automatically converted into decimal latitude and longitude values. If a value has previously been entered into the Verbatim Coordinates field, you can try to click the double arrows (\u0026quot;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026quot;) to the left of this field to try to auto-convert them into decimal latitude and longitude. Township-range-section coordinates cannot be automatically converted in the data entry form, but they may be converted into an appropriate georeference using the GEOLocate tool. For more information about this and about using the coordinate tools, see this tutorial video.\nEx: 34° 13.940' N 112° 2.370' W, 12 420944E 4064025N, TRS: T40N R32E S29 See Darwin Core\u0026rsquo;s verbatimCoordinates.\n Elevation in Meters:  The elevation in meters at which the specimen was collected.

Symbiota is an open source software that provides content management for biodiversity data while serving as a data access portal and aggregator. Learn more about Symbiota on the project website.   I would like to use Symbiota for my collection. What should I do?      Visit the list of existing Symbiota portals and determine whether your collection fits within the scope of any of these portals.\n  Contact the portal administrator or help desk email of the portal you would like to join. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find this, fill out this form to request to join an existing Symbiota portal.\n     How do I get my data into a Symbiota portal?    Once you\u0026rsquo;ve joined a portal (see FAQ question above), you can import your data as a spreadsheet (converted into CSV format) or as a Darwin Core Archive. Instructions for uploading your data can be found on this page; however, it\u0026rsquo;s advised to get help the first time you upload data. For assistance, email the Symbiota Support Hub.   How do I upload images into a Symbiota portal?    Free image storage in Symbiota portals is not unlimited, and therefore, there are no batch uploading tools in the portals. Please contact the Symbiota Support Hub for image hosting options.\nIf you host images on your own web-accessible servers (i.e., all of your images have public URLs), you can use the Image URL Mapping tool to associate these images with your occurrence records.\nFor a more comprehensive description of how images are handled in Symbiota portals and your options for image hosting, watch our recorded webinar on this topic.\n   How do I change the description and contact information for my collection?    Instructions for editing your collection metadata can be found on this page.   How do I request access to redacted data in a Symbiota portal?    Depending on the portal, the Symbiota Support Hub may be able to help you get the right permissions for your request. Please fill out this form, providing as much information as possible, to request access.   How do I add taxonomic names to a Symbiota portal?    If the taxonomic name(s) you\u0026rsquo;d like to add are associated with specimens in your collection, you may be able to automatically add those names using the Taxonomy Cleaning Tool. This tool will auto-import any names that it finds in the Catalog of Life that match names in your records.\nWhen this tool does not prevail, contact your portal administrator or the Symbiota Support Hub about adding names to the taxonomic thesaurus. It helps to provide a list of references (e.g., publications, online articles) associated with the names you\u0026rsquo;d like to add.\n   What do I do if I don’t remember my username or password?    Locked out of your account? Don\u0026rsquo;t create a new one! Click the Reset Password or Retreive Login link on the login page to your portal.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t receive the password reset email shortly, check your spam folder. If you still don\u0026rsquo;t see it, contact the Symbiota Support Hub to hard reset your password.\n   ","tags":[],"section":"faq"},{"date":"-62135596800","url":"https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/search/","title":"Site Search","summary":"let params = { json_src: '../index.json', minlength: 3, defaultsearch: 'AND', sort_date: 'DESC', autocomplete: 1, section_search: 0, badwords: 'and,there,the,this,that,you', json_wait: 'Loading\n', json_ready: '\n', extern_icon: ' (external link)', err_badstring: 'Too short!\n', err_noresult: 'Unfortunately no search results were found.
