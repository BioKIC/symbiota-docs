#### Welcome to the User Guide!

This guide describes how to use tools and functions that any member of the public can access. For many of these functions, you will need a user account, but you do not need to be granted editor or administrator permissions to do these things (e.g., make checklists).

For information about becoming a data editor, see our [User Permissions](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/permissions/) page.

To create an account, click the New Account option in the toolbar of any Symbiota portal, enter the requested information, and click Create Login.
