* **Search Records:** search through the records that you have entered into this profile. You can conduct custom, detailed searches from this interace. Tutorial information can be found [on this page](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/).
* **Add a New Record:** tutorials for [adding records here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/add/full/) and for [editing records here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/)
* **Print Labels:** print labels for specimens of all types, including specimen packets. [Tutorials here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/label/).
* **Print Annotation Labels:** print annotation/determination/identification labels for specimens that already have full labels. [Tutorials here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/label/annotation/).
* **Submit image-vouchered observation:** use an image to create a new record, if you did not collect a specimen for the record. The available data entry fields are similar to those used to add a new specimen record (see above).
* **Review/Verify Occurrence Edits:** view, revert, or apply edits that you have made to your records. [Tutorial here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/review/).
* **Download backup file (CSV extract):** download a copy of your data to review or send to a collection. CSV files may be opened in Excel or a similar spreadsheet software.
* **View User Comments:** because your data are publicly visible, users may leave comments on your records. Use this tool to view and manage those comments. See [this page](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/comment/) for more information.
