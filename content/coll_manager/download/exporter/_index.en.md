#### Downloading Specimens without Georeferences

The Exporter tool also has the option to download all records without georeference data. To do this, select Georeference Export from the dropdown menu in the Export Type box at the top right of the Exporter tool. Select the search terms/filters to apply to your download and click Download Records.


#### Downloading Records that have been Batch Georeferenced

For Snapshot collections (i.e., collections that do not manage their data live in the portal), there is also an option to download georeference data for specimens that have been batch georeferenced in the portal.  To do this, select Georeference Export from the dropdown menu in the Export Type box at the top right of the Exporter tool. Select the search terms/filters to apply to your download and click Download Records. The resulting file will include the following fields: 
* institutionCode
* collectionCode
* catalogNumber
* occurrenceId
* decimalLatitude
* decimalLongitude
* geodeticDatum
* coordinateUncertaintyInMeters
* verbatimCoordinates
* georeferencedBy
