{{< notice info >}}
  This page describes how to associate externally hosted media resources (e.g., images) with records in your portal using a CSV of links/URLs. 
{{</ notice >}}

### Adding Media Resources via URLs
  1. Navigate to your Administration Control Panel (My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of your collection).
  2. Click Import/Update Specimen Records, then select "Extended Data Import".
  3. Click the "Choose File" button to upload a properly formatted associations file into the uploader (see sections below for formatting requirements).
  4. Select "Media Field Map" from the Import Type dropdown menu.
  5. Click the "Initialize Import" button.
  6. Select the [**format**](https://ac.tdwg.org/format/) for your media item from the dropdown list. Note that only one type of format may be uploaded at a time.
  7. Map the fields in your input file (shown on the left) to appropriate target fields (see table below).
  8. If you would like to create a new record for each identifier that does not match an existing identifier in the system, check the box labeled "Link media to new blank record if catalog number does not exist."
  9. Click the Import Data button.

{{< notice tip >}}
  ⚠️ When providing media resources via URLs, the URLs should begin with "**https://**" (not "http://") in order for them to display correctly in various browsers. This is especially important for thumbnail images. If you provide media links using URLs containing "https" and they do not display correctly in your Symbiota portal, check that the server that hosts your media resources maintains an SSL certificate that supports the use of "https".

### Setting Up a Media Import File
A template for this upload type can be found [here](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/documents/GeneralResourceUploadTemplate.xlsx).

The required fields for this upload type are (1) a subject identifier for the occurrence you are linking to (occurrenceID, catalog number, and/or other catalog number), and (2) originalUrl. The originalUrl should include **a direct link to the desired media resource** (i.e., ideally ending in .jpg or .tif or some other media file extension). Note that uploading a link to a webpage where that media resource may be found (e.g., YouTube) rather than directly to the media resource may result in media not displaying as expected.

Optional fields are included in the table below.
