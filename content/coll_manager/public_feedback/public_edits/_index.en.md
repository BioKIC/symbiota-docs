  This page describes how any Symbiota user can suggest modifications to an occurrence record. This can be a useful feature for community members to remediate data quality issues.

### Enable Public Edits
The option to enabled public edits is managed on a **per-collection basis** and is activated through the [Collection Metadata Editor](/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/metadata/#collections_metadata). Turn this on by navigating to the _Administration Control Panel > Edit Metadata_ and check the box for _Allow Public Edits_.

Once activated, any portal user who is logged in can suggest changes to your occurrence records using a paired-down version of the Occurrence Editor form. Public users cannot suggest edits to _Catalog Number_ or _Scientific Name_ values.

| Once Public Edits are enabled via the [Collection Metadata Editor](/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/metadata/#collections_metadata), any user who is logged into the portal can suggest changes to individual occurrence records. |

### Review Public Edits

To review suggested changes made by public users:
1) Navigate to the _Administration Control Panel > Review/Verify Occurrence Edits_.
2) In the Filter panel, set _Applied Status_ = "Not Applied" and select _Submit Filter_ to filter out pending public edits to your occurence records. 
3) Proceed to use the [Specimen Edit Reviewer](/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/review/) to accept and reject suggested changes to your records.
