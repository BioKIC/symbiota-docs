{{< notice info >}}
  In Symbiota portals, the **glossary** is a list of terms and their definitions relating to the content of the portal.

Key points regarding Symbiota glossaries:
* Glossary terms can be linked to both characters and character states used in [identification keys](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/idkeys/).
* Glossary entries can include definitions, images, links to outside resources, and translations.
* Glossary entries can be linked to a specific taxonomic group above the level of family (i.e., to the entire clade to which the term applies) and/or to other, related glossary terms.
* The glossary can be edited by superadministrators and anyone who has been granted *Glossary Editor* permissions. Glossary Editor permissions can only be granted by a Superadministrator (i.e., portal manager). See [User Permissions](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/permissions/).
* The glossary is publicly available on most portals via the sitemap *only after at least one entry has been added to the glossary*. Until then, the glossary is linked in the Sitemap under **Administrative Functions (Super Admins only)**. To make the glossary more accessible, you can add a menu item or link to the "/glossary/index.php" page on the homepage or another location on the site.
* The glossary is not pre-populated by default and must be manually curated.
* There is currently no user interface for batch uploading glossary entries. Batch additions must be facilitated by a portal administrator on the backend.
