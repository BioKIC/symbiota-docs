## June 2022-current: Checklists permissions

The "Create a Checklist" permission has been granted for the majority of existing users in active Symbiota portals, for those accounts created before June 2022. If a user does not have "Create a Checklist enabled", and needs it, you might be asked to add these user permissions to their account. Additionally, **all new users will need to request permission to create checklists/datasets moving forward**.

"Create a Checklist" permissions may now be granted by the administrator of any collection in a portal. In your Administration Control Panel, click "Manage Permissions", and scroll all the way down to the "Checklist/Dataset Management Sponsorship" box. From here, you can grant checklist/dataset creation privileges to any user. If you are a superadministrator, go to the "User Permissions" page in your "Sitemap", and click the user that needs permissions.

In the user profile page, find the "Assign New Permissions" options, and mark the checkbox that says "Create a Checklist", and then click the "Add Permission" button to complete the process.
