The Symbiota data schema is strongly aligned to the <a href="https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darwin Core</a> data exchange standard. For more details, links to the Darwin Core definitions are supplied for each term. Learn more about Darwin Core terms in the following TDWG pages:

### Standard Fields

{{< dwc-term id="catalogNumber" verbatim="Catalog Number" descr="The unique identifier (primary key) for the specimen record. This field should be used to store the barcode or the accession number (herbaria only). This field is enforced to be unique per collection" ex="WIS-L-0123456, ASU0012345, 12345" dwc="catalogNumber" >}}


<a id="otherCatalogNumbers"><b>Additional Identifier Values:</b></a> Any other identifier for a specimen record that is not the central catalog number. This field is typically used to store the old catalog numbers, accession numbers, National Park identifiers, etc. Identifiers can be assigned a tag name to distinguish it from other identifiers (e.g. old accession #, NPS#, etc). These identifiers map best to dwc:otherCatalogNumbers definition, and thus included in the exports under this field. More information about this system can be found on the <a href="https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/fields/catno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalog Numbers documentation page</a>.<br>Ex: 12345, TUZI 3082, NPS Acc #: GUIS-M-00126.<br>See Darwin Core's <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:otherCatalogNumbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">otherCatalogNumbers</a>

<a id="localitySecurity"><b>Locality Security:</b></a> Checking the Locality Security checkbox will hide locality details below the level of county from unauthorized users. This is typically done because the species is rare or threatened. Images are also hidden to protect locality details that might be viewable from the label. Users that are logged into the system and have the necessary permission to view locality details (e.g. collection managers) will continue to have access to all data. This box will automatically be checked if the species name is on any of the rare species lists &nbsp;(see sitemap). If one wishes to lock protection (on or off), click the Lock Security checkbox and/or enter a reason for security override in the text field. Leaving the locality security unlocked will allow default settings to be applied as determined by the sensitive species administrators, which is the recommendation for most records. <br>

Latitudes from the southern hemisphere and longitudes in the western hemisphere (e.g. USA) should be entered as negative values.

See below for more information on using this tool." ex="34.874022, -111.75774" dwc="decimalLatitude" >}}

{{< dwc-term id="coordinateUncertaintyInMeters" verbatim="Uncertainty (meters)" descr="The accuracy of the georeference coordinates in meters (numeric value only). This is measured as the radius of a circle where the true point would be found if known. If coordinates are collected using a GPS, than the accuracy would be the error found within the GPS unit (usually around 10m). While previously collected specimens that have coordinates on the label recorded by the collector typically do not state the source of the coordinates (GPS, map, etc), it is typically a good assumption that the coordinates are accurate within one to two hundred meters. If the locality details are vague such as just \"Grand Canyon\", then the coordinates should be the centroid within the uncertainty encompassing the greater area where the specimen may have been collected. If the locality is \"Boynton Canyon, Sedona\", the uncertainty would be about 1500 m. This field autofills when using GeoLocate for georeferencing." ex="42000 for Phoenix, 20000 for Salt Lake City" dwc="coordinateUncertaintyInMeters" >}}

<a id="verbatimCoordinates"><b>Verbatim Coordinates:</b></a> If the coordinates recorded on the specimen label are in a format other than decimal degrees, enter them here. When decimal lat/long fields are blank and one enters UTM or DMS using one of the formats displayed in the example below, decimal lat/long values will be automatically generated. Click the "&lt;&lt;" symbol to replace existing decimal values. This field autofills when using the DMS, UTM, and TRS georeferencing tools.<br>
Ex: 34° 13.940' N 112° 2.370' W, 12 420944E 4064025N, TRS: T40N R32E S29 <br>

<a id="verbatimElevation"><b>Verbatim Elevation:</b></a> The verbatim elevation at which the specimen was collected. This is typically used to record an elevation measurement that was recorded in feet or an uncertainty designation. When the elevation in meters field is left blank, the value will automatically be converted to meters. Click the "&lt;&lt;" symbol to replace the previously entered meters values.<br>
