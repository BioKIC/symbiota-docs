### Navigating to Records to Transcribe
1.	Once you are logged in, click the Crowdsourcing tab from the main menu or the link provided by your event leader.
2.	Your stats will be shown in the top right side of the page under Your User Status. Here you can see how many specimens you have transcribed, as well as how many points are awaiting approval and how many have been approved.
    * Pending points are those that have not yet been reviewed by a curator. _Curators are very busy, please be patient if your pending points don’t turn into approved points very quickly!_
    * Approved points are those that have been reviewed and approved by a curator
3. In the table at the bottom of the page (titled **Your Stats by Collection**), click on the link in the "Open Records" column next to the name of the collection you would like to work on (or the collection instructed by your event leader).
4. On the resulting page, you’ll see a table of specimen records that require transcription. Select one of the specimens by clicking on its Symbiota ID number (leftmost column).
    * If you see a message that says Record Locked!, go to the next specimen by clicking the double arrows at the top right of the form.
5. Transcribe the record as instructed.
