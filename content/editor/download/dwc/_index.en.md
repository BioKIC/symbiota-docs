  This page describes how you can download Darwin Core Archive files (DwC-A; standard format for data publishing and sharing) from a Symbiota portal.
{{</ notice >}}

**If you are an administrator of a collection**, you can download a Darwin Core Archive of your collection in one of two ways:
* Navigate to your Administration Contol Panel (My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of your collection) and click Darwin Core Archive Publishing. If you have already created a DwC-A, click the link next to "DwC-Archive File:". If you have not yet created a DwC-A, [create one](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/data_publishing/dwc/).
* Navigate to your Administration Contol Panel (My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of your collection) and click Download Data Backup file. The backup file will be in the format of a Darwin Core Archive, but all specimens will be included in the file, even if they don't have unique GUIDs.

**If you are not an administrator of a collection, or you would like to download a DwC-A of another collection**:
1. Navigate to the Sitemap of the portal (generally an option on the menu).
2. Under "Collections", click Darwin Core Archives (DwC-A).
3. Find the collection for which you would like to download a DwC-A and click the link in the DwC-A column. The size of the file will be displayed in parentheses.
