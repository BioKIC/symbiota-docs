The GEOLocate Collaborative Georeference Tool (CoGe) can be activated and integrated in a Symbiota portal to engage multiple users in a central georeferencing platform outside of the portal. More information about this platform can be found here: [GeoLocate CoGe page](https://coge.geo-locate.org/).

A training course for georeferencing using GEOLocate CoGe can be found here: [GEOLocate CoGe Training Course](https://www.capturingcaliforniasflowers.org/georeferencingcourse-coge.html), and a written protocol can be found here: [GEOLocate CoGe Protocol](https://www.capturingcaliforniasflowers.org/uploads/1/6/3/7/16372936/georeferencingincoge.docx).

For instructions on how to push specimens from your collection to CoGe, visit the [collection manager CoGe page](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/georeference/coge/).
