### Scoring traits for a single specimen

Navigate to the Occurence Editor for the occurrence you wish to score (see [this page](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/) for help finding specimens) and click on the Traits tab. Any traits available for scoring will be displayed in boxes in this tab. To view additional scoring optiosn for a given trait, click the black triangle at the top right of the box (highlighted below). From here, you can score the traits from any available images.
